Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go
That's the way they all come through like
Low cut, see-through shirts that make ya
That's the way she come through like

‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know
How
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce
How
Do I say I'm sorry?
‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce

Tight jeans, double Ds makin' me go
All the people on the street know
Iced out, lit up, make the kids go
All the people on the street know

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
‘Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know

To make love to something innocent

How

‘Cause the word is never gonna come out
Now
L-O-V-E's just another word I'll never learn to pronounce

You know that type of shit just don't work on me
Whistlin' and tryin' to flirt with me
Don't take it personally
'Cause we were never in love
It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singin' out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar
'Cause L-O-V-E's not what this was

I think I should know (Whoa-oh)
How (Whoa-oh)
To make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out (Whoa-oh)

My first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist
Well, my first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist

I said no more teachers and no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers, hoping that nobody looked
Lips like liquorice, tongue like candy
Excuse me miss, but can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car, on the way to the bar
I got you on my lips (I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs with my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

And I wake up in the morning with the taste of your tongue

Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now (Yeah)

I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravellin', they're sayin'
""What would you wish for if you had one chance?""
So airplane, airplane, sorry, I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank

I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days (Days)
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So, can I get a wish to end the politics? (Oh)
And get back to the music that started this shit?

Nothin' on You (feat. Bruno Mars),B.o.B,"2 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishB.o.B - Nothin’ On You feat Bruno Mars (Tradução) Lyrics

Lindas garotas em todo o mundo, eu podia seguir
Mas meu tempo seria desperdiçado
Elas não são nada comparadas à você, amor
Nada contra você, amor
Elas podem dizer ""Oi"", e eu poderia dizer ""Olá""
Mas você não deve se preocupar, com o que dizem
Porque elas não são nada contra você, amor (Sim)
Nada contra você, amor
Na-na-na nada contra você, amor, na-nada contra você, ha
Sim

Eu sei que você sente de onde eu venho (De)
Independentemente do que fiz no meu passado (Fiz)
A maioria foi realmente só por pura diversão (Diversão)
Em um carrossel, só fiquei girando (Girando)
Sem direção, apenas tentando ganhar alguma coisa (Alguma?)
Indo atrás de saias, vivendo sob o sol do verão (Sol)
E assim eu perdi mais do que eu já tinha ganhado (Ganhado)
E honestamente, eu acabei sem nada (Hein?)

É tamanho absurdo, está na minha consciência
Estou pensando ""talvez eu devesse tirar""
E eu não quero soar redundante, mas eu estava pensando
Se houvesse algo que você queira saber (Que você queira saber)
Mas não importa, devemos deixar para lá (Devemos deixar para lá)
Porque nós não queremos ser um episódio de TV (Episódio de TV)
E todos os maus pensamentos, deixem para lá (Lá, lá, lá, lá, hein)

Lindas garotas em todo o mundo, eu podia seguir
Mas meu tempo seria desperdiçado
Elas não são nada comparadas à você, amor

Nada contra você, amor
Na-na-na nada contra você, amor, na-nada contra você, ha

Mãos para baixo, nunca haverá outra (não)
Eu estive andando por aí, e eu nunca vi outra
(nunca)
Porque o seu estilo, eu realmente não sou nada perto
(nada)
E você fica selvagem quando não veste nada (Haha)
Baby você é o pacote completo
Além disso, você paga seus impostos
E você fica na real, enquanto as outras só fantasiam
Minha Mulher Maravilha, me chame de Sr. Fantástico
Pare, agora pense nisso

Eu fui para Londres, eu fui a Paris
Fui até bem longe, Tóquio
De volta para casa, na Geórgia, em Nova Orleans
Mas você sempre rouba a cena
E assim como essa menina, você me paralisou
Como um de Nintendo 64
Se você nunca soube bem, agora você sabe, sabe


Aonde quer que eu vá, sempre ouço o seu nome
E não importa onde eu estou, menina você me faz querer
Cantar
Quer seja um ônibus, avião, carro ou trem
Não penso em mais ninguém, você é a única a ser culpada


Sim
E é assim que fazemos
E eu vou só deixar esse passeio

Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know, when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, uh
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing

And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it (Get it)
Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side (Yeah)
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by ""Bubba,"" and he hit that dance like thunder (Okay)
I ain't from Dallas, but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now, everybody tryna do me (Jockin')
I leave the functions, and all the ladies tryna screw me (On me)
Now you just do you, and I'ma do me (All day)
Niggas love to hate, so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie  (Dougie)

The name is Yung (Yup) for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West, but I can teach you how to Dougie
I step up in the club, and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin', none of 'em know me
I hear the squad screamin' like, ""Ayy, get it, brodie""
So I move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like ""How he do that? He can Dougie on the floor""
And when that nigga stop, they like ""Dougie some mo'""
I'm like ""A nigga kinda tired,"" then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and got the whole crew ass

Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie  (Dougie)
Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie (Dougie)

All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone (Hm)
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm 'bout to escape with a bitch and head home (Fuck it)
She got her friend, so it's a two-man and
I wanna run it even if her legs long (Yup)
She like ""You hubby,"" I think she love me
But, I change the subject and I do my Dougie (Ha)
'Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gon' make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head, this bitch looked at me funny
Dawg, bitch, you can't tell me nothin'
Star made the beat, and I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans 'cause the burner keep rubbin'

All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, ""Keep it drama free""

Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to somethin' better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)

Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

What am I doin'? What am I doin'?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over

Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinkin'?

About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm gettin' home
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fuckin' red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I'd done it, throwin' hundreds
When I should be throwin' ones, bitch, I run it, ahh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

I'm livin' life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

Uh, one thing 'bout music, when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end gettin' any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm ridin' through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinkin' I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feelin' this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long

But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving

Stereo Love - Radio Edit,Edward Maya,"6 ContributorsStereo Love (Radio Edit) Lyrics
When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

Can I get to your soul? Can you get to my flow?
Can we promise we won't let go?
All the things that I need, all the things that you need
You can make it feel so real
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you baby, I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

I came to see you, but I just might go overboard tonight
I came to see you, but I might go inside
I think I found the one that'll hold my heart
I wanna feel your heart, we're in love tonight

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I",1199.0,stereo love - radio edit,edward maya

I get tired and upset
And I'm trying to care a little less
When I google, I only get depressed
I was taught to dodge those issues, I was told
""Don't worry 'cause no doubt
There's always something to cry about""
When you're stuck in an angry crowd
They don't think what they say
Before they open their mouth, you gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles, get your old grin back
Don't worry 'bout the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
'Cause they whisper too loud for me

Hot topic
Maybe I should drop it
It's a touchy subject
And I like to tiptoe 'round the ship going down
You got pennies but no pounds
So if your business is running out
It's not my business to talk about
But they don't think what they say
Before they open their mouth, you gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me
Pack up your troubles, get your old grin back

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

(I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid) Yeah
(To take a stand, to take a stand) It's been a ride
(Everybody, everybody) I guess I had to
(Come take my hand, come take my hand) Go to that place to get to this one
(We'll walk this road together, through the storm) Now some of you
(Whatever weather, cold or warm) Might still be in that place
(Just lettin' you know that you're not alone) If you're tryna get out
(Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road) Just follow me, I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game like a ""Fuck you"" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings, instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road (Same road, same road)

And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me, you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazin', and

I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm

Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever

Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men

Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)

And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine

Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Life is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations

Lightning strike
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?

Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak

I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

It's heartbreak warfare

I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'til the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart
With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
With half of my—

Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you that
Half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violence-prone poor-people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam
Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest, survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we strugglin', fighting to eat
And we wonderin' when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now, we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

So many wars, settlin' scores
Bringin' us promises, leavin' us poor
I heard them say, ""Love is the way
Love is the answer,"" that's what they say
But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we strugglin', fighting to eat
And we wonderin' when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now, we say

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes—
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes—

(Oh)
(Oh) And then it goes—
(Oh)
(Oh)
And everybody will be singing it (Oh)
And you and I will be singing it (Oh)
And we all will be singing it (Oh)
Oh, oh, oh (Oh)

When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes—
When I get older, when I get older
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

When I get older
When I get older
I will be stronger

Oh, yeah, yeah

Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough
How come we don't say ""I love you"" enough?
'Til it's too late
It's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
And we could make a feast from these crumbs, yeah
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
So if your life flashed before you
What would you wish you would've done?

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking it
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh

And if your plane fell out of the skies
Who would you call with your last goodbye?
Should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
When we long for absolution
There'll be no one on the line

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given here
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking it
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh
Like we're dying, ohh, like we're dying
Like we're dying, ohh, like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying
Yeah

Mmm, you never know a good thing 'til it's gone
You never see a crash 'til it's head on
Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong?
You never know a good thing 'til it's gone

Yeah, we gotta start
Looking at the hands of the time we've been given
If this is all we got, then we gotta start thinking
If every second counts on a clock that's ticking
Gotta live like we're dying
We only got eighty-six, four-hundred seconds in a day
To turn it all around or to throw it all away
Gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying, oh

Kane is in the building
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig

She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it better than I've ever seen I done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground, but how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thing or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big, there's just one thing that I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?

I be like knick, knack, patty, wack, oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla) and the caramel (And the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate), I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Before you make it big, well, there's just one thing that I gotta know

When We Collide,Matt Cardle,"6 ContributorsWhen We Collide LyricsYou say ""I love you boy""
But I know you lie
I trust you all the same
And I don't know why
Cause when my back is turned
My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale
So hard to hide
I still believe
It's you and me
Till the end of time
When we collide we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise i know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard
Sitting in a wishing hole
Hoping it stays right
Feet cast in solid stone
I got Gilligan's eyes
I still believe
It's you and me
Till the end of time

When we collide we come together
If we don't, we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise i know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard
Cause you said hello
It's where the going get's hard
Our future is far
Many of horror
Our future's far
Many of horror
Our future is far
Many of horror
I still believe
It's you and me

If we don't we'll always be apart

Cooler Than Me - Single Mix,Mike Posner,"16 ContributorsCooler Than Me (Single Mix) Lyrics
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow, shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't shit
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise (Shh)

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But, you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me
You got designer shades just to hide your face
And you wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say hey or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You, you, you got your highbrow, switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise (Shh)

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

'Cause it sure seems (It sure seems)
You got no doubts (You got no doubts)
But we all see (We all see)
You got your head in the clouds

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

So take it easy on me

We're sick like animals, we play pretend
You're just a cannibal
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude, but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

She said ""I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""
She said ""I love you more than words could say""
She said ""I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by""

So I said what you're saying girl it can’t be right
How you can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
But she said ""But boy I loved you from the start""
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said ""Stop this crazy talk""
""Leave right now and close the door"" (she said…)

She said ""I love you boy I love you so""
She said ""I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""
She said ""I love you more than words could say""
She said ""I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by""

So now I’m up in the courts pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, I’m innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected, had her heart broke by someone she obsessed with
Cos she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That’s why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cos she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears in the gallery
This has got bigger then I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons, Valerie
But the jury don’t look like they’re buying it
And this is making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I’m trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murderers
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna send me down even though I told 'em she

She said ""I love you boy I love you so""
She said ""I love you baby oh oh oh oh""
(yes she did)
She said ""I love you more than words can say""
She said ""I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by""
So I said ""Then why the hell you gotta treat me this way?""

Turned into a real sticky situation

The way you looked when you said you were leaving
The way you cried as you turned to walk away
The cruel words and the false accusations
The mean looks and the same old frustrations

But we threw it all away

I may be scared and a little bit frightened

No one that can make me feel so good

When everybody, everybody said we never would

And just when I, I start to think they're right

Standing on the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world
Back then we were like cavemen
But we map the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

You know no one dies
In these love drowned eyes
Through our love drowned eyes
We’ll watch you sleep tonight

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

Bleeding, but none of us leaving
Watch your mouth son
Or you’ll find yourself floating home

Here we come now on a dark star
Seeing demons, not what we are
Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike but now will end today
There’s progress now
Where there once was none
Where there once was none
Then everything came along

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
(Learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Now we’ll never dance again",1803.0,the flood,take that

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh-oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)

Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I got a new job now on the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride

Praying won't do it, hating won't do it
Drinking won't do it, fighting won't knock you out

Hiding won't hide it, smiling won't hide it
Like I ain't tried it, everyone's tried it now
And failed somehow

So when you gonna let me?
When you gonna let me out, out?

Denying won't do it, crying won't drown it out

I would try to break through

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way

Let's go...
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more hits than a disciplined child
When they see me everybody brrrrraps, brrrrrraps
Son I’m like a young and fully black Barrack
I cried tear drops over the massive attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to Earth

I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped cause we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying

I even done the legal stuff and was leaded astray
They say money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyones a kid that no one cares about
You just have to keep screaming until they hear you out

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Oh
Written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the man
Ohhhh
The seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way!",2215.0,written in the stars (feat. eric turner),tinie tempah
"Hey, Soul Sister",Train,"96 ContributorsHey, Soul Sister LyricsTrain’s first single from their 2009 comeback album Save Me, San Francisco. A ukelele and soulful based beat made it their biggest hit and the best selling single of 2009.
Hey, hey, hey

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

Hey, hey, hey

Just in time
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction
A game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey, soul sister
Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?
The way you move ain't fair, you know
Hey, soul sister
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do
Tonight

The way you can cut a rug
Watching you's the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of, you see
I can be myself now, finally
In fact, there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

Billionaire (feat. Bruno Mars),Travie McCoy,"57 ContributorsBillionaire Lyrics“Billionaire” is a song by Travie McCoy with additional vocals from Bruno Mars, from his debut studio album, Lazarus. The song portrays what McCoy and Mars shall do if they became a billionaire!
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, ""Here, lady, have this""
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette (Good job)
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it (Woman)
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate (Haha)
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up (There you go)
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks (You too)
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream (Uh-huh)
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Young Money)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl (Kane is in the building, nigga)
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

Ooh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock

(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock, girl
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
(Ooh) I-I-I-I can make your bed rock (Ayy!)

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad
And I ain’t leavin' fast, I'ma stay awhile
Hold your head, Chris, I-I'ma take it down!

Don't underestimate the things that I will do

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew

They were never true, never true

Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

And I threw us into the flames

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
'Cause it wasn't that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster 'cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
'Cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn't 'cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it 'cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
Some bullshit; people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, 'cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I'm 6'8""

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

By the time you hear this, I'll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin'
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see

There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged the bullet, uh
I'm so over you, so baby, good lookin' out

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had

And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had

You don't deserve my tears

I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh, baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

I know you want me back, it's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away, Lord knows that it would take
Another place, another time, another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that (Ah)

Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had

And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana

I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said ""I love you""
Could have wrote you a line or two

""Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me""
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me ""Lip Parade""
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I, and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now, to know it in my memory

And at once, I knew
I was not magnificent

High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice

Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight, yeah
Some people give their life, oh (Yeah)

They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the T off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top

Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote

I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

Okay, no one wants to help, I guess you're on your own
Build a foundation with the bricks they throw
In a black and white world, true colours show
Change if you want, everybody grows
And life's like an eel, but try and get a hold
Opinions ain't facts, take 'em in and let 'em go (That's right)

Louder,DJ Fresh,"8 ContributorsLouder Lyrics
I can't control this feeling
Something's happening inside me
Our senses come alive
The chemistry is building
It's something that we're feeling
There's nowhere you can hide

It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

Perpetual emotion
It's just a ripple in the ocean
A shadow in the night
Changes we're making for the better
We're going through together
There's nowhere you can hide

It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher
I wanna burn, wanna burn, burn like a fire
We gotta move, gotta move, gotta move faster
You can't tame this energy inside

It's more than a feeling, we're building a dream that we've always had clear in our sights
Watch it ignite as we open our eye, it's the one way we know to survive
We're powerfully changing the world we're reclaiming, our unity they can't divide
They push us around but we're tearing it down and we're having the time of our life

It's gonna get, it's gonna get, it's gonna get louder
We're gonna get, we're gonna get, we're gonna get stronger
We're gonna feel, we're gonna feel, we're gonna feel better
You can't tame this energy inside
We gotta reach, we gotta reach, we gotta reach higher

I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don't mean
Like, ""What's up with your best friends? We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas? And why'd they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fuckin' allegations
I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the takin' (Watch me take it)

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only gettin' older, somebody should've told you

I'm on one, yeah
Fuck it, I'm on one, yeah

Huh, I'm burnin' purple flowers, it's burnin' my chest (Huh)
I bury the most cash and burnin' the rest (Stuntin')
Walkin' on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still runnin' with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Ha-ha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo)
Huh, baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feelin' ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it's double M-G 'til I get the chair, chyeah

You know the feds listenin'; nigga, what money?
I'm a made nigga, I should dust somethin'
You niggas on the bench, like the bus comin'

Ohh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant

Put an end to your world like the Mayans

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, everyday, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy, or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader
You're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that

But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings

I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions

You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that

When I touch your body, I feel I'm losing control
'Cause you can't deny, you've blown my mind
When I see you baby, I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart?
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, don't let go to my love

I came to see you, but I just might go overboard tonight
I came to see you, but I might go inside
I think I found the one that'll hold my heart
I wanna feel your heart, we're in love tonight

I can fix all those lies
Oh baby, baby, I run, but I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside
My heart is in pain, but I'm smiling for you
Oh baby, I'll try to make the things right
I need you more than air when I'm not with you
Please don't ask me why, just kiss me this time
My only dream is about you and I",1199.0,stereo love - radio edit,edward maya

To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I'd like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight, I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh-woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh-woah (Shake him off)

And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
It's always darkest before the dawn (Shake him off)
(Oh-woah)
(Oh-woah)

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause lookin' for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)
Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride

Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all
All

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural

Go, go, go, go

Oh lover, don't you dare slow down
Go longer, you can last more rounds
Push harder, you're almost there now
So go lover, make momma proud
(Turn the lights on)

(And when we're done) I don't wanna feel my legs
(And when we're done) I just wanna feel your hands all over me, baby

But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there (You can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here
Baby, I'mma be your motivation (Uh-huh, yeah)
Go, go, go, go

Uh, girl I turn that thing into a rainforest
Rain on my head, call that brainstorming
Yeah this is deep, oh, but I go deeper
M-make you lose yourself, and finders keepers
It go green light, go Weezy go
I like to taste that sugar, that Sweet and Low
But hold up wait, new position
I put her on my plate then I do the dishes
She my motivation, I'm her transportation
'Cause I let her ride, while I drive her crazy
Then I just keep going going, like I'm racing
When I'm done she hold me like a conversation
Weezy, baby

But you can't stop there, music still playin' in the background
And you're almost there (You can do it, I believe in you, baby)
So close from here

Oh lover, when you call my name
No other, can do that the same, no
I won't let you get up out that game, no
So go lover, go 'n make me rain

(And when we're done) I don't wanna feel my legs

So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make-up

Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia

You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine

You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, mm
For a second you were here (Hey), now you over there (Hey, hey)
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love (Ayy), never had a love (Ayy)

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sittin' here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out

It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body (Hey)
Like you never had a love (Ayy), uh, had a love (Ayy)

Oh, and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listenin', but
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartendin' and strippin', baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin'

Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path

Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass

To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs

Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for

Hey
Ayo, Sap, what's good, bruh?
This man's kinda high out here

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, ""fuck it""
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit? (Hey)

And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw

That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit

One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together

That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win

They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in

That's, that's, that's when we all win

The right thing to guide us
Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat)

(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together

Lisa likes brandy and the way it hits her lips
She's a rock'n'roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all
Working at a nightclub that was called ""The Avenue""
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Looney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone
And from the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

Some people wear their history like a map on their face
And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home
Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
When chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal
And from the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend
You've got heart and you go in your own way
L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
What you don't have now will come back again
You've got heart and you go in your own way

On my last night on Earth, I won't look to the sky
Just breathe in the air and blink in the light
On my last night on Earth, I'll pay a high price
To have no regrets and be done with my life

L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N
You've got more than money and sense, my friend

You're not yourself
Even when you're here with me
I know that you're somewhere else

So put another record on, kiss and lead me on
Nothing really matters when we're dancing
Listen to the same sad song playing on repeat
'Cause every time we come this close, my heart skips, skips a beat

So come on, spin me around

We can't let go
If you really have to leave
One more time, just move me slow

At the start of the night I was like, what? Let's have a team talk
Playing with this lady isn't something I'd agree for
Vibes keep going up and down like a see-saw
Should have just taken her to the cinema to see Saw
Ooh, she let me sleep with her, I figured her figure's a sure, sure winner
Plus I got a lead from the back, I'm a skipper
You make my heart skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip a beat (Skip a beat)

So come on, spin me around
Now I don't wanna go home
'Cause when you hold me like this
You know my heart skips, skips a beat
I know I should, but I can't leave it alone

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

Oh, this has gotta be the good life

Like this city is on fire tonight

Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now

What there's to complain about

Não estou trabalhando duro?
É, certo, fotografe isso com uma Kodak
E melhor ainda, vá à Times Square
Tire uma foto minha com uma Kodak
Tire a minha vida do negativo ao positivo
E eu só quero que todos vocês saibam
Que à noite, vamos curtir a vida
Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo!
À noite eu quero tudo de você, à noite
Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam, nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor), vamos fazer isso à noite
(Eu quero você à noite, eu quero que você fique
Eu quero você à noite)
Pegue alguém sexy e diga-a, me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite

Ocupe-se à noite porque cada vez mais faço o mal antes a Prius
Desesperado à noite, posso te fazer minha rainha
E fazer amor com você infinitamente
Isso é insano
A maneira como o nome cresce, o dinheiro se mantém fluindo
Os trabalhadores se movem para o lado
Então estou na ponta dos pés, mantenha fluindo
Fiquei trancado como a Lindsay Lohan
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer te sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã mas prometo a noite
Dale
Me perdoe
Mas eu posso beber um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite
E querida, eu posso te fazer sentir tão bem à noite
Porque nós podemos não alcançar o amanhã

Me dê tudo à noite
Para todos sabermos que podemos não alcançar o amanhã
Vamos fazer isso à noite
(Não se importe com o que eles dizem
Todos os jogos que eles jogam, nada é suficiente
Até que eles mexam com o amor)
Vamos fazer isso à noite, (eu quero você à noite
Eu quero que você fique, eu quero você à noite)

Pegue alguém sexy e diga-o, me dê tudo à noite
Me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite, me dê tudo à noite
Alcance as estrelas
E se você pegá-las, pelo menos você está no topo do mundo
Pense nisso
Porque se você escorregar, eu irei cair em cima de você, garota
Coloque bolas quando eles dormirem no Macy's
E não há segredo
Minha avó é de Cuba, mas sou americano
Amarrado sobre o dinheiro, como Seacrest
Coloque isso na minha vida, querida
Posso fazer você se sentir bem, querida
Não posso prometer o amanhã mas prometo a noite
Dale
Me perdoe
Mas eu talvez beba um pouco mais do que deveria, à noite
E eu posso te levar pra casa comigo se eu puder, à noite

Expectations forget rep
Ain’t never begged yet
When I wanted to get pence hustle
To be I am exactly what my neck says
That sket said I tried to cash in on my Dad's death
I wanted to vent but I never said: ""Fuck all""
After all you were never kin to me
Family is something that you never been to me
In fact making it harder for me to see my father
Was the only thing that you ever did for me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (Dear Dad)

As a kid I looked up to you
Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do and how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think I used to blame me
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you would have been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, I’m not afraid
They can read all about it (Read), read all about it, oh

Oh, oh, oh
I write songs I can't listen to
Oh, oh, oh
Everything I have to give to you
Oh, oh, oh
And everyone of these lines I sing to you

My job's more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it and come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You see me smile
Now you're gonna have to see me hurting
'Cause pretending everything is alright
When it ain't, really isn't working

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream 'til the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers (Yeah), I’m not afraid
They can read (Read) all about it, (Read, read) read all about it, oh

To your neck of the woods, I want to lick a little bit

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em
Oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best, boys
And I'll wear my pearls",1945.0,if i die young,the band perry

Break down, now sleep, build up breakfast
Now let's eat, my love, my love, love, love (La la la la)
She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine

The fear has gripped me, but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And I, ah-ah-ah-aha

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me, baby, are you mine?""

She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt

Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature

And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo

A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

Listened to the screamin' of the wind

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do

You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire

And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms
And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs

Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way

You said that you could let it go

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town

It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick

Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing timе
Hidden behind all thesе big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be ... ... ...
You escaped what I escaped

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

Now, I done grew up round some people
Livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel
Some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That “I'ma get fucked up”
Fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute
And the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip
Then somebody said to me

“Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch”
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Then, I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

“Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear, ""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
​m.A.A.d. city

G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the livin' room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath

The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?

All of our bridges burned down

Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it

Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for

Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees

The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From Dirty Paws and the creatures of snow

Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes

Blow Me (One Last Kiss),P!nk,"34 ContributorsBlow Me (One Last Kiss) Lyrics“Blow Me (One Last Kiss)” is a song by American singer Pink, released as the lead single from her sixth album, The Truth About Love.
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""whys"" will all be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss

All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments, now the accounts are overdrawn

I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

Honey, it's your son, I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills, we had a lifestyle to front
And, tonight, I swear I'll come home and we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow, you'll cook dinner for the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

And I say, ""Liberate your sons and daughters""
The bush is high, but in the hole, there's water
You can get some when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high, but in the hole, there's water
As you will, she'll be the whole of the law
And if it don't feel good
What are you doing it for?
Now tell me

Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
There's a hurricane in the back of her throat
And she thinks she's made of candy

Liberate your sons and daughters
The bush is high, but in the hole, there's water
As you will, she'll be the whole of the law
And if you don't feel good
What are you doing it for?
What are you doing it for?

Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be in love, love, love

And every day
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels
And leaving without them
And leaving without them

Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

And with words unspoken
A silent devotion
I know you know what I mean
And the end is unknown
But I think I'm ready

Drive By,Train,"57 ContributorsDrive By LyricsThe lead single from Train’s latest album, California 37, here, Pat Monahan, the lead singer of Train, tries to make his lover believe in his claim that their relationship, was not just a one night stand.
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now, here you are again
So, let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh, but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

Please believe
That when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply

50 Ways to Say Goodbye,Train,"50 Contributors50 Ways to Say Goodbye Lyrics
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

We share somethin' so common, but still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbin', even here inside these walls
Breakin' each others hearts and we don't care 'cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much

We Own It (Fast & Furious),2 Chainz,"148 ContributorsWe Own It (Fast & Furious) Lyrics
It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!

Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with?
This moment (Uh), we own it

And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you lookin' for me, you can find Wiz
In a new car or the crowd with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
Ain't no other squad I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo) (Uh)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)
This moment, we own it

This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside, uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)

Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
One thing about it: got a problem? I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? (I ride or die for love)

The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

Now, it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
""Why'd you only call me when you're high?""
""Hi, why'd you only call me when you're high?""

Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen

Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts

But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

And love is the prize

But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on

You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head

All good just a week ago
Crew at my house
And we party every weekend, so
On the radio
That's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know
Like I won't be here long
Now, the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor (No)
Girl, why is you lyin'? (What?)
Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa
Gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes
Now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva

Either the head is so hydra
Or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" (What?)

Got a house full of homies
Why I feel so the opposite?

But now I care more
Man, nobody out here's
Got it figured out, so therefore
I've lost all hope of a
Happy ending, depending
On whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame
We blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine
Or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone
Whole crew sing a swan song

Never took your side, never cursed your name
I keep my lips shut tight, until you go-o-o-oh
And we've come as far as we're ever gonna get
Until you realise, that you should go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

In the dying light, I'm the only one here
And I will cover you, until you go-o-o-oh
'Cause if I told the truth, I would always be free
And keep a prize with me, until you go-o-o-oh

Come in misery, where you can seem as old as your omens
And the mother we share
Will never keep your proud head from falling
The way is long, but you can make it easy on me
And the mother we share
Will never keep our cold heart from calling

Into the night, for once, we're the only ones left
I bet you even know where we could go-o-o-oh
And when it all fucks up, you put your head in my hands
It's a souvenir for when you go-o-o-oh

I'm friends with the monster
That's under my bed
Get along with the voices
Inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me
Stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy
Yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it
All could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down
Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

So turn the volume loud

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note

I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide

________
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit à chanter des chansons d'amour
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit, constamment à boire et à chanter
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit, embrouillé à chanter ces chansons d'amour
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit, à me noyer dans toutes ces chansons d'amour
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit à chanter des chansons d'amour
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit, constamment à boire et à chanter
Elle m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit, embrouillé à chanter ces chansons d'amour
Elle m'a gardé éveillé à jacter toute la nuit

Okay, retournons à quand je dormais chez ma mère
Et même à quand j'étais là-bas, sous la bienveillance de Mohammed
On payait dix-sept cent pour le loyer, l'argent fut bien dépensé
Pas de chauffage, mais un gars nous a mis au chaud, j'ai suffoqué
J'ai ressenti quelque chose pour toi, j'ai même écrit la chanson Dreams pour toi
Parce que j'ai des rêves pour toi, je pensais à une bague pour toi
Des gamineries, tu connais les gosses et les histoires
Des bouquets d'fleurs anonymes envoyés, tu connais les trucs de bouffons
Maintenant, le mec a signé chez Hov, il a pris de l'assurance
De retour à la maison comme un adulte à présent et cette ville est mon trône maintenant
Ces mêmes clubs qui avaient l'habitude de me jeter
C'est lorsque tu ne veux pas qu'on te pique ta place et que tu met un message place réservé
Car maintenant j'suis dans cette salope, et j'me pavane
Les anciennes meufs pleurent parce qu'elles savent ce qu'elles ont loupé
Mais moi j'suis toujours sur toi, j'pense toujours à toi
Mon verre se reverse sur moi, alors que je pense à toi
I'm saying

Me croirais-tu si je te disais que j'suis amoureux
Chérie, je veux que tu m'aimes
Me croirais-tu si je te disais que j'suis amoureux
Chérie, je te veux
Et toi et moi, toi et moi, toi et moi
Ça m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit
Et toi et moi, toi et moi, toi et moi
Tout c'que j'chante c'est des chansons d'amour
Et toi et moi, toi et moi, toi et moi
Ça m'a gardé éveillé toute la nuit
Et toi et moi, toi et moi, toi et moi
Elle m'a gardé

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
Et si jamais je couche avec elle, ce sera le plus grand orgasme jamais vu
L'amour est une drogue, c'est comme la plus dure des héroïnes jamais vues
Et putain! J'suis défoncé là, tu m'comprends?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Elle pourrait me faire l'épouser dans un club, mec j'pourrai laisser tomber mes potes pour elle
Like, ""give me 20 dolla, dolla""
Tellement con, j'me demande comment t'as pu aller au lycée
J'suis dans ta ville et je me demandais si t'étais à la maison maintenant
Went and found her man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace

And then you bite your lip, whisper and say

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Ayy, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines

Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope nope, y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushin'
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothin'
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility
And then we keep marching, I said…

Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Je vais enlever quelques étiquettes
Avec seulement 20 dollars dans ma poche
J'suis, j'suis à la chasse, à la recherche de bonnes affaires
C'est vraiment énorme

Là j'avance dans la discothèque en mode “Un problème ? J'ai une grosse bite !”
Mais en fait j'suis juste excité car j'ai acheté quelques sapes au thrift shop
La glace sur les franges est tellement givrée
Les gens sont genre “Putain, frais le beau-gosse”
J'arrive, m'enfonce, direction la mezzanine
Vêtu tout de rose sauf mes chaussures en croco, qui sont vertes
Je porte un vison de léopard, une fille est débout à côté de moi
J'ai probablement dû lavé ça, il sent comme les draps de R. Kelly
(Pisse)
Mais putain, ça coutait 99 cents
Je m'en fous, je le porte, je le lave, je suis sur le point de sortir et me faire complimenter
Je laisse passer ces mocassins dans lesquels quelqu'un d'autre a marché
En mode clodo et grunge, rien à foutre, je crâne et je me la pète et
J'économise et je suis putain d'heureux, ça c'est une affaire, pute
J'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père, j'vais piquer le style de ton grand-père
Non, en vrai, demande à ton grand-père : “j'peux récupérer ses vieilles sapes?”
(Merci !)
Combinaison en velours et des chaussons d'intérieur
Veste en cuir marron-merde que j'ai trouvé en fouillant
Ils avaient un clavier cassé, j'ai acheté un clavier cassé
J'ai acheté une couverture à foutre, puis j'ai acheté un kneeboard
Salut, salut, mon gars ace, mon mellow
John Wayne ne peut pas test niveau franges, oh non
Je pourrais prendre des Pro Wings, les rendre cool, les vendre

When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh

Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard
'Cause I know when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh

I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go

I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

Hey hey hey
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away
It's a beautiful day

It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
'Cause now I'm alright
You might've had me caged before, but not tonight

And you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don't want to say “so long”, I just want to say “goodbye”

It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
And I know there's no denying
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up and the music's playing
And even if it started raining
You wouldn't hear this boy complaining
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got away

'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
My time with thinking of our break-up
Then you've got another thing coming your way
'Cause it's a beautiful day

The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey) Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

(Hey) Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say

To move to a place so far away

The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face

Somethin' bigger than us and beyond bliss

Loyal (feat. Lil Wayne & Tyga),Chris Brown,"11 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “Loyal” by Chris Brown feat. Lil Wayne  and Tyga LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic! Let's stop talking about Chris Brown. Let's talk about someone else, anyone else! What's top 5 on the Rap charts?
*Pitbulll*
STILL!?
*""Show Me""*
Already reviewed that
*""Monster""*
No, I need to lay off Eminem for a while. Who else?
*""My Nigga my nigga, my nigga my nigga""*
Hm…
*""Stoner""*
…as soon as I figure out what he's saying, I'll get back to you…
Wow, man. Nothing good to review on the Rap Charts! Well, what's on the pop charts that has featured rappers on it? *""Chris Brown* *sigh* Okay, fine, I'll talk about… this song, from Chris Brown. Okay, let's have a listen…
""You thought it was over?""
I kinda hoped…
I know these hoes ain't right
When a rich nigga want you, and your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal…
Wait, didn't I JUST review a song about women cheating on their boyfriends? *""What's Love""* Yeah, not JUST a song about having sex with a girl, or just a couple of one-off lines about someone isn't faithful, no, that's not good enough. THE PREMISE OF THESE SONGS are SPECIFICALLY about taking someone else's lover
These hoes ain't loyal…
The thing is, this isn't like most songs nowadays that are so busy, you can ignore the lyrics. Here, he says the lyric, followed by 3 awkwardly long seconds of silence, and it directly draws your attention to his message. But hold up, maybe I'm just too stricken by the similarity of the last song to make a fair judgement of this one, maybe I should judge the song on it's own merit, and not directly compare it to another one that I didn't like. I should try to look at it with fresh eyes. Okay, my palette's cleansed. Alright, hit me, Chris Brown… oh, dammit…
I wasn't born last night
Oh wait, this song starts with a verse from Wayne, because… because of course it does…
I wasn't born last night, I know these hoes ain't right
I think women are evil! But oddly enough, they're my biggest fan base. Life is stupid like that…
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ring nor her ring on last night
…A quick service announcement to all men out there: if you just recently found out that you've been cheated on, for the love of God, do NOT turn to the hiphop station on your radio

*scenario*
Guy: *Gets in his car* I can't believe my girl would be so unfaithful, man. I… I need to hear some loud raucous rap music to get my mind off of things! *turns on radio*
*""That's why I fucked your bitch""
""I can fuck your bitch""
""I'll take your biiiiitch…""
""WE GETTIN' TURNT UP!
WE GETTIN' TURNT UP!
WE GETTIN' TURNT UP WHILE WE'RE HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S WIFE!
WE GETTIN' TURNT UP!
WE GETTIN' TURNT UP!
I DON'T RESPECT RELATIONSHIPS!""
Why give a bitch your inch when she rather have nine?
Ooooh, some kinda clever wordplay. Now see, here's the thing: if you're gonna be a douchebag, at least be clever about it. So, what else ya got?
You know how the game goes, she be mine by half time

Okay, you get a point for continuing some serviceable wordplay
I'm the shit--
Oh God. Please, no more poop jokes. We've had enough from you.  It's not cool anymore, it's definitely not smooth
*montage of poop jokes*
You've referred to yourself as feces so much, and in so many descriptively disgusting ways, my mind doesn't even register that it's supposed a euphemism for being awesome anymore. It just sounds like you're actually bragging about being human waste. And… I will ignore the low hanging fruit that stems from you constantly admitting to being human waste, in order to say Wayne: there's no humor in it, you've thoroughly deconstructed all various angles at which one can extract references to crap in relation to complementing one's self, I beg you: GIVE IT A REST!!!! *sighs* But, since he's already set it up, you know he's gonna say it. So go ahead Lil Wayne, compel us with your latest comparison to defecation
I'm the shit, ooh - nigga, that's that nerve
Wait… no poop joke? No worn-out, tired, uninspired wordplay about doo doo?
I'm the shit, ooh - nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Wow. I gotta say, I… I respect that. It's almost like he's growing as an artist. Okay, now back to the topic of disrespecting women
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
Hey, Wayne… about ""not trusting these hoes"", as it were, um… don't you have, like 4 kids with 4 different women? I mean, I know that's a little personal, but if you've got 4 kids with 4 baby mamas, that would suggest you've trusted quite a few hoes, particularly with birth control options
Oh I'm sorry, I was being thoughtlessly disrespectful to the mothers of his children. What were we talking about again?
These hoes ain't loyal…
Yeah, yeah… but… wait a minute. Maybe I shouldn't be so mean. I should give these guys the benefit of a doubt. And you know why? Because these guys live in a different world than I do. Let me explain. Okay, these guys are rich, and money attracts people,  but that doesn't mean it necessarily attract better people, it just attracts MORE people, and the simple fact is, a LOT of people are douchebags, especially those who think they can get over on people with money. And, ipso facto, women are going to be among this collection of douchebags, but where the guys who are douchebags can only do so much when it comes to trying to get some money from them, women have the persuasive advantage of sexuality on their side, which no doubt makes their requests for money and material items a little harder to resist. In fact, the duplicitous nature of these scandalous women is further exacerbated by knowing that some of them have boyfriends that they are completely willing to cheat on without a second thought in order to achieve their shallow goals. And so, this song is made with that disgust in mind, scoffing at women who would sink so low as to betray the trust of a lover in exchange for diamonds and fancy clothes. That's a sentiment I guess I can get behind
Took a broke nigga's bitch
Wait, so… YOU'RE the one who's actively trying to have sex with HER?
When A rich nigga want ya
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
...
Well, then you suck, too! In fact, who the hell are you to judge her?! Seriously, you dis these women for being shallow because she's only interested in your money, but how much better are you, since you're only interested in her body? Both of you are equally shallow jackwagons, because You BOTH know that there's someone who's going to be hurt by what you're doing, and you seem to revel in that fact. And you know what? maybe you could've justify this somewhat by adding in some lines about how her boyfriend cheated on her, and she's getting revenge, or maybe he hasn't been home a lot, and she just wanted to be intimate with someone again, but NOPE. She's just a ho who trades sex for the chance that you'll spend money on her
Took a broke nigga's bitch, I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Sooo… you took someone's girl… and claimed that you can make this broke girl rich… but you don't mess with broke girls… so… did you NOT do the first thing you just said you did? Because… I'm pretty sure taking someone's girl counts as messing with them. But hey, let's go with the other possible interpretation of this awkwardly worded lyric. ultimately, he's saying that he only talks to girls who have their own money, and since these girls he exclusively talks to are already financially stable, that eliminates the chances of them being gold diggers, and maybe he can meet girls who are interested in him because of his *start laughing* sweet, kind, loving personality HAHAHAHA! Oh, God, that's too funny…
Got a white girl with some fake titties
And I'm sure you're really interested in her sweet loving personality
She wanna see a nigga trapped
Yeah, sh… ye-- yeah?
She wanna fuck all the rappers
Uh… what was that part about girls with big boobs trying to get you trapped? Well, maybe, he's just talking about the type of girls I mentioned before that only use sex in order to influence guys to get them fancy clothes and whatnot. But wait, you made it clear that you don't deal with broke women! I'm pretty sure most broke girls can't afford breast implants, especially not with broke boyfriends, so like you said, you only talk to rich girls, the type of girls that don't need your money anyway… so which is it, Chris? Girls who are already rich and don't need your money, or girls who want to exploit your exploitation of them...or lack of proofreading? OR maybe he's saying something else there?
She wanna see a nigga TRAP
She wanna fuck all the rappers
Maybe he's saying that she wants to see him trap, like trapping, you know, the latest metaphor for selling drugs. Well, in that case, ma'am, you're fresh out of luck, because Chris Brown is not a rapper, and he damned sure doesn't sell drugs. Speaking of which though, isn't there another rapper on this song that we have to get through? Maybe he'll lend some some cohesive story or give some focus to this song

Okay, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin'
Eh, let's not
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
Um… hold on…
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Are you sure about that?
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
If so, why does it sound like you're begging her? I mean, you could say she's teasing him or something, but that doesn't match up with the rest of the song, where he painted himself as being such a dominant alpha male who took charge of the situation, women just couldn't help but throw themselves at his feet. I mean, he seemed pretty confident in his thesis statement:
These hoes ain't loyal!
So why, all of a sudden, is he having a hard time with her?
These hoes ain't loyal!
*I swear, they're not, she's gonna call back, just give it a second…*
Seriously, it sounds like things aren't working out as well for him. So, when I hear this:
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You just spent your bread on her
And it's all for nothing
He sounds like the bad guy in a movie who thinks the love interest is going to double cross the hero, but doesn't realize that it's not going to happen
Haha! After all the love and affection you gave her, your lady friend was on my side the entire time! Take him down, Katherine… I said, she was on MY side the entire time! Take 'em down, Katherine! *Katherine cocks gun* Oh--  *raises hands* oh…
Anyways, my ultimate problem with this song is that… it's not really catchy, but where the production would usually make up for that in these types of songs, here, it's just kinda limp and inoffensive, and awkwardly unfitting for the topic of the song, which I have no choice but to pay close attention to, and what's revealed is a bunch of jackasses without morals and writing that doesn't showcase a lot of consistency. One minute he's taking broke girls from broke men, and the next he doesn't like broke girls because they're shallow and materialistic, all the while the only thing he wants to do is have sex with them. It's spiteful, hateful, and oddly enough tries to act like it's okay, almost as if he doesn't realize exactly how spiteful and hateful it is, and the bouncy, happy synth line just adds to the confusion. You know, I think another problem I have is that, usually these types of songs about cheating on your boyfriend are justified by something intimate being wrong with the relationship, like the girl wasn't being treated with respect, or, hell, he wasn't listening to her in the bedroom, you know, there's something primal or emotional that's not being responded to due to negligence on the part of the man in question that the singer is taking over for, but here, the only flaw on the part of the other man that's addressed is ""He doesn't have enough money"", which, needless to say, isn't that much of a character flaw, at least not to my poor person brain. I dunno, maybe to rich people, being poor is the equivalent of drowning puppies. And so I have to ask, who is this song for? He doesn't even really seem interested in pleasing her sexually or emotionally, which lets me know that this song CAN'T be for the ladies, aside from the fact that he's calling out every girl he meets as a ho, but it CAN'T be for the fellas, because they never address the other man in the third person, no, they're talking DIRECTLY to you, the listener with the girlfriend, so I have no choice but to assume this song is purely for terrible people who wish to align with this sort of thinking and sing along to it while they cheat on they're spouses, which… hey, I guess those people need their music too, but even so, these guys are so wrapped up in themselves, they never really try to make it appealing to the listener, they just kinda put out this dickish personality as is and expect you to think it's cool on principal, not giving a second thought to how they actually present their personas, and I just don't like it
I'd give this a rating, but… that would be validating Chris Brown as a rapper. well, I'm the Rap Critic… most of the time… you don't have to like my-- But wait, you may be asking, ""aren't there several different versions of this song? There's one with Too Short and one with French Montana! You should review those too!"". *look blankly* No, I shouldn't--

Don't,Ed Sheeran,"140 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoDon’t LyricsWritten about a relationship Sheeran went through, “Don’t” is believed to be about Ellie Goulding, though it’s never been officially confirmed.
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days

But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)

You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it, 'til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind and it's nothin' but me
On it (On it, on it), now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want (Shh)

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy (Oh)

Show Me (feat. Chris Brown),Kid Ink,"4 ContributorsRap Critic Reviews: “Show Me” by Kid Ink feat. Chris Brown LyricsHi, I'm the Rap Critic, and… look, I know pop songs are typically lazily-written, blatantly sexual, and just the lowest common denominator when it comes to portraying any sort of intelligence, but this is just… okay, let's start from the beginning
This is Kid Ink. His main attribute is that he has tattoos. Like, a lot of tattoos. Other than that, he, uh… look, he's the new version of whoever had a hit song last year, but didn't stick around long. For all intents and purposes, he's j-kwon version 10 for the year 2014. And if you don't remember who J-Kwon is, well, that's exactly my point. So, here's Kid Ink's 2014 reimagining of the 4,348th song about being in the club and wanting to have sex with a girl, but… in the assembly line of mediocre pop/rap songs, something happened in the process that made this particular product defective.  and it starts with Chris Brown, who should be weaving one of those suggestive yet subtle pop song choruses that R and B singers are known for, right?
""Baby let me put your panties to the side (uh)""
….You know, that's romantic…
But seriously, wow, talk about cutting to the chase. You know, most songs usually have some some sort of build up to an explicit lyric, some set up of some kind. Jeez, even Enrique Igacias at least begged her pardon first *""Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude""* before saying, *""But tonight, I'm fucking you""* . But when you just kick off a song with ""Baby lemme put your panties to the side"" I can't help but feel like we skipped a few steps. It just seems a little contrary to the smooth R and B singer thing he's trying to pull off
""I'mma make you feel alright
‘Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah""
Okay, now we're back into the vague, obviously sexual but in no way descriptive style of songwriting that you guys are known for!
""Mami you remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is (I don't know)""
….*amused, quick-off-and-back glance*
""You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now""
…*chuckling* You've gotta be kidding me! Are you really gonna base the hook of this chorus around an unfinished pick up line?
""You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now""

Don't try to act like this is some slick turn of phrase, you sound like you just couldn't read what the songwriters gave you on the note pad!
""Mami you remind me of something
But I don’t know what it is (I don't know)""
I don't know what… what is this trying to do?! Are you trying to pass off forgetfulness as sexy? You guys must think amnesia is downright titillating! no really, I wanna know the thought process behind this. Maybe, they realized how corny pick up line choruses were getting, especially after whole bedrock debacle, and thought they could do a Seinfeld-type one up move by comparing her to… nothing. Nah, that sounds too existential. Was this, maybe… some sort of homage to that old R. Kelly song?
""You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is""
But wait, in THAT song, he immediately starts using comparisons
""You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it""
Sure, they're stupid comparisons, I mean, I don't think any woman wants to be compared to a jeep, if being compared to cars at all. I mean, if you were, why not something like a maserati, or a lamborghini, those are some sexy cars. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's an adult actress NAMED maserati, because that sounds cool. But, no girl would call herself a jeep. I mean look at this thing, it's bulky and asexual at best. You might as well call her a van. So, maybe they weren't referencing that song. Maybe this chorus was just completely improvised, and he just blurted out whatever came to mind first
""Hands in the air, looking' for a bitch right now""
Yeah, that would explain a lot.. But wait, I didn't let the chorus continue, maybe there's something in there I forgot about. What does he say after that line?
""Cause you remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me (alright) *looks confused*
You remind me of something (uh)
But I don’t know what it is right now (I don't know)
You remind me of something (uh)
Girl you gotta show me""

Wait, so that's what you were doing? That was your ace in the hole? Trying to turn your absentmindedness into the reason why she should have sex with you? Look, when I hear a song where someone's talking to a member of the opposite sex, I usually imagine what it would translate to in real life. And when I hear this, this is the only way it translates to me:
""Girl, you remind of... of something, but I don't remember what it was… so why don't you remind me… by having sex with me…
As far as I can imagine, there's just no way to make this sexy. Unless of course, you're a well-known celebrity, in which case, the chorus could be interpreted like this:
Girl, you remind me of, um… of, uh…*girl: uh-huh?*... look, I'm rich and famous and I want to have sex with you. Can we just skip to the part where we… *girl: yeah, sure…* Alright, let's go
And with the obvious ""You could never say something this stupid to a girl unless you're as rich as me"" mentality that this chorus has been written in, it pulls me out of the song immediately… and we haven't even gotten to the rapper yet!
Uh, on the real no lie
I don’t know what it is but you just my…
Okay, I see we're just gonna get the same obliviously stupid mannerisms that we've heard on the chorus. in fact, I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's obvious that I'm not going to get anything clever from this song
Got a cup in your hand (hand)
Baby sitting but you ain’t got no kids
Rhyming ""hand""…. with ""kids""… You know what? This song is already promised a VERY low rating because of Mr. Brown over here, so unless there's some great payoff to that crappy chorus, it's not redeeming itself. So, come on, let's skip ahead to the lyric that says what she reminds him of, because there's no way they'd set up such a chorus without some punchline SOMEWHERE
We ain’t leaving ’til there ain’t no more left (yeah)
Can’t see no time on the Rolex
Yeah, yeah, your watch has so many diamonds, you can't see the time, everyone's said it, and you're not special. Keep going
Go on the floor like a doormat (uh)
Baby you know where to throw that

Wait… is that what she reminds him of, a doormat? Because she ""goes on the floor""? Well, I hope not, because… calling a person a doormat, has… a bit of a negative connotation to it, so this can't be it, let's… keep going
Uh, so tell me what your name is
I don’t really care who you came with (no)
Nope, he doesn't bring… really, now? Is that what you're going to say to her?
""So, girl, what's your name?""
""Well, I'm Kiesha, I just came with my best friends…""
""Haha, I don't care…""
Unless you got a couple friends look like you
""That is, unless of course, your friends are hot, because then I'll want to have sex with them, too… and… by openly telling you this, I'm assuming it won't be a problem, because, I mean, when has a girl ever been jealous when a guy tries to talk to other women?
My bad if my ex try to fight you
Oh yeah…
Okay, I'm sick of this, and the way he thinks chatting up girls at the bar works is not helping, but that chorus still frustrates me, so I want to get to the point: what is the thing that she reminds him of? I have to know
You remind me of…
Oh, here it is! Here's the thing she reminds him of! All will be revealed!
You remind me of something missing
Misses, you got my full attention
So… she reminds him of… something missing, like in his life, which is a ""mrs."", a spouse, a loving companion… WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT
So, this song was building up to him telling her she was wifey material? Oh, I'm sorry, maybe the fact that you were talking about pulling her panties to the side 2 minutes before you even asked what her freaking name was kinda threw me off!
This gets a 0 out of 5. It's crap. These lyrics are horrendously irredeemable, from the word go. The very first line of the chorus socks you with a bad taste in your mouth, and what follows are a bunch of lines that NO ONE would get away with in real life, so there's no connection you could make with it. The problem is that the way the chorus is written, with forgetting what he was going to say, sounds like it should have been played for laughs. But it's not. They wanted you to take that seriously as a slick pick-up line, There's nothing smooth about what he said, and there's nothing cool about it. It sounds like it was written by a bunch of jackasses who have no idea how human interaction works, and I just can't deal with it

I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been

That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind

There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery

You're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love

Watch you slip through my hands

Hey! Where's the drums?
Woo, oh-oh-oh (Let's go!)

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to, you're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me when I just wanna make you smile?

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel, I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna do you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind

Take a moment for yourself
Get close with the lights down low
You and I and no one else
I get the feeling that I wanna explode
Baby you grab my attention
Tension burning, fever high
Take me to another dimension
Tonight the rules do not apply

I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive
I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive
When we're crashing, let's have passion
Boy, you've got my heart on overdrive

This is where I wanna be
Hands up, feel the bass in my heart
Give me faith and I will leap
I take the risk cause you're never too far
Right now I'm drowning in emotion
Caution flies right out the door
Baby you're pushing this devotion
I can only ask for more

I can't stop this feeling baby
Only you can make me come alive

Wrapped Up,Olly Murs,"22 ContributorsWrapped Up Lyrics
Now excuse me if I sound rude
But I love the way that you move
And I see me all over you, now
Baby, when I look in your eyes
There's no way that I can disguise
All these crazy thoughts in my mind now
(There's just something about you)

You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees, ha

You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so high, I can't come down
(You got me wrapped up, baby)

I don't ever wanna give up
All this spell you got me under
I see fireworks when we touch now
(There's just something about you, you)
Your body fits on mine like a glove
Let them say whatever they want
It's too late 'cause you're in my blood now
(There's just something about you, you)

You got the lock
I got the key
You know the rest
You know just where I wanna be
Don't ever stop controlling me
I kinda like it when you bring me to my knees, ha

You got me wrapped up
Around your finger
I'd do anything for your love now
And when you touch it, the feeling lingers
Takes me up so high, I can't come down

You got me so, so wrapped up (Oh)
There's just something about you, you

My princess so intelligent
Make me wanna reapply to school for the hell of it
I'll be the student, you be the teacher
Ms. Sophisticated, such a pleasure to meet ya (Hello)
Yeah, but here's the only issue since we met
You kinda turned my world upside down (Upside down)
And I don't really mind Spiderman kissing you
As long as you're planning on sticking around
The happiest boy in the world award goes to me
Not a chance, nobody came close to 'em
I kinda knew you was troublesome
You got me wrapped around your finger like bubblegum

Everything that you do (Everything you do)
Every way that you move
There's just something about you
There's just something about you, you
Everything that you do
Every way that you move
There's just something about you

As far as I remember, his topics range from ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink"" to ""party party party, and drink, drink, drink … but, like, in another country this time!"". Geez, even Sean Paul did a love song every once in a while! And I don't have a problem with party music in general, far from it, it's just that anything involving Pitbull's music has a very… processed feel to it, like a prepackaged, factory-sealed, product. Every one of his mini-verses seem like such cliff notes versions of rap music tropes, it's insulting
Like, dude, come on, LIE TO ME. Can you at least pretend like you're more than ""the go-to guy for optional rap verses on pop songs""? You know how on some radio stations, they'll cut out the rap verse of a song, leaving you with 30 seconds of an awkward voiceless backtrack, as you rap along to words that you could swear were there the last time you heard it? ""California Gurls"". Yeah, because apparently there's still a large amount of people out there who just can't stand the thought of rappers in popular music, so much so that there are radio stations across the country who market themselves on the idea that, ""Hey, if you listen to us, you don't have to wory about all that pesky rap nonsense that's ruining music!"" *play intro to ""California Gurls"". Wait, they even cut him out of the intro? He's not even rapping there!
I have NEVER heard of something like this happen to other genres of music. I've never heard of a radio station dedicated to editing out violins and saxophone solos from songs because some people don't like jazz or classical music. In fact, I've never heard of a rap station that prides itself on cutting pop singers out of rap songs, but when it comes to rappers on pop songs, people are still saying ""get that damn talky noise out of my ear,"" so much so that you can bank your radio station's appeal on that sentiment alone? That's… disappointing, to say the least. Wait, who were we talking about again? Oh yeah, Pitbull. Sorry, I got distracted by something interesting...
But yeah, Pitbull to me, always ends up sounding like a guest artist on his own songs most of the time. In fact, I'm surprised no radio station's gotten confused and accidentally cut the the rap verses out of his own songs. *example of Pitbull's song being edited*
You know, I reviewed a Flo Rida song a year or so ago, and the only reason I decided to do so was because it was called ""I Cry"", and a title like that meant that maybe he would say something I could actually make a full episode ago. And, well, he did say a few things, but for the most part, it was kinda typical. But hey, at least there was that initial interest. Now, Pitbull's a little different from Flo, in that, admittedly, his Spanish heritage gives him a a little bit of flavor to his lyrics, but not in a really substantial way. But, like Flo Rida, I figure if I do hear a song from that sounds like it'll stand out, I give it a try
Then, I heard this song, ""Timber"". *song intro* Well that's…certainly different. A country western rap song from a guy from Cuba and a woman who was obviously raised in… in… Nashville, Tennessee? Oh… well, she doesn't sound like it! *beat switches to typical club music* Uh… and neither does this song anymore. Really, the harmonica is the only thing keeping the country theme together. And yeah, the sample comes from a 70's bluesy song, but… look at this video. I think you know what they're going for
It’s going down, I’m yelling timber
You better move
I will say, that's a relatively witty, catchy first lyric. Unfortunately, I wouldn't say it's strong enough to build a whole song around,  but given how generic the rest of the chorus is, it leads me to believe that that first lyric was the only reason this song was made.  Like, they were thinking, ""Hey, guys, how's this: ""it's going down... like someone shouted timber, get it?"" And… uh… rednecks like trees, right? Rednecks, lumberjacks, same thing, am I right? Am I right, fellas? No, seriously, is that right? I don't know…
""Let's make a night *Or, a song* you won't remember""
Okay, let's stop wasting time. Let's get to pit bull. So basically, let's waste more time...
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

Okay, that's not a bad opener, continuing with the trees-slash-party metaphor, in that the bigger the tree or the bigger the party, the more intensely hard it's gonna go down. That's… ok
This biggity boy’s a dignity dog
Also, I appreciate the callback to the 90's with the Das EFX's placement of ""iggety"" in the middle of words, which is fitting, because it pays homage to the HipHop tradition that, even back in the 90's, rappers could get famous off of spitting a bunch of unimportant nonsense. Seriously, listen to ""They Want EFX"" and tell me it held some deep message about the human condition:
My thigh bone's connected to my knee bone
My knee bone's connected to my hardy-har-har-har
No Parks sausages, mom, please
Oh-h-h-h-h-h-hhh I'm steamin, a-go-ny!
B - I - N - G - O-oh
You do the hokey pokey and you turn yourself around, hon, so uh
Dun dun dun dun dun, dun dun
I'm pretty sure those guys just got high and tried to reference everything from their childhood as quickly as possible. Hm… I wonder if they went on to write for Family Guy. *play ""Price is Right"" loser horn, look to camera, shrug shoulders*
I have ‘em like Miley Cyrus, clothes off
Twerking in their bras and thongs, timber
I understand that Miley Cyrus is a buzz word right now when it comes to twerking, but *show miley twerking*  I don't think that's because she was good at it
Face down, booty up, timber
That’s the way we like the what, timber

Okay, really, what is up with rappers censoring themselves on the uncensored versions of songs. I get it if it's done for an effect, like a joke or something, but THIS lyric is a reference to a very explicit 2 Live crew song:
""FACE DOWN, ASS UP, THAT'S THE WAY WE LIK TO FUCK""
And he's not making a joke about it, he sounds like he was tapped on the shoulder and told to make the lyric less explicit by saying ""booty"" instead ass and saying ""that's the way we like to WHAAT!?"" like his parents just walked in while he was recording the lyrics
""Face down, booty up, that's the way we like to WHAT!?! Mom, dad, you weren't supposed to be in the studio today?!
Look, when the only reason you're self-censoring your words is so because you're actively trying to be more radio friendly, then just erase the lyrics and say something else!
Look up in the sky, it’s a bird, it’s a plane
Nah, it’s just me, ain’t a damn thing changed
I guess that's an okay reference, saying that even though people may seem him as someone whose ego's reached a great height as far as fame and wealth are concerned, he's still a down to earth guy, but… when you watch the video, it ruins any charm it might have had. He just looks so smug about a line that wasn't really that great. *show his face* Get it, I compared myself to superman, hehe… well, I thought it was funny…*
Club jumping like Lebron, now Voli
You know, I would be angry about this blatant interruption of the song for the sole purpose of product placement, but honestly, I'll take this over what he did on the ""Give Me Everything"" song, which, at the very start of the song, synergized repetition of product placement with the fact that rhyming words with themselves has become openly accepted as a way to rap in order to give us this gem:
Me not working hard?
Yeah, right! Picture that with a Kodak
Or, better yet, go to Times Square
Take a picture of me with a Kodak
Why yes, Pitbull DID have a deal with Kodak. How did you know? Well, anyways, let's get back to the verse:

Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it’s going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it’s going down
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have skipped to the bridge near the end of the song, let's back up by about 45 seconds
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it’s going down
Wait, I'm sorry, I went too far back! Now, we're in the middle of the first verse, and… wait, keep playing that part
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it’s going down
…No… This man, instead of making two full verses, just repeated a two bar phrase for the second  half of BOTH verses. You… cheater!!! Dude, n… really? You just COULDN'T be bothered to write two complete verses? I mean, hey, I guess that makes both our jobs easier. Whatever, you know what? I give this a 2 out of 5
You could give this song credit for trying to do the country western approach with the harmonica, and the intro that sounds like a more bluesy/country western feel. And to Pit's credit, he's... just not on the song long enough to annoy me. His mannerisms are there, but they're tolerable. Well, except for the ""just repeat one phrase to substitute as the second half of the verse"" thing. It's so obviously jarring to hear, because to my ear, it truly feels like he ran out of things to say and just plugged in the bridge that was supposed to go at the end to make up for unfinished verses. As well, after a while, the phrase ""it's going down"" is used so much, it starts to feel like one of the writers was someone's out-of-touch dad who just figured out what ""it's going down"" meant, and REALLY wanted his kids to know that he was hip to the lingo
It's goin' down
It's going down
It's goin' down
It's going down
It's goin' down
IT'S, ABOUT, TO GO, DOWN!
After a while it starts to feel forced, like they're TRYING to make it popular, or people JUST started saying it and they're trying to make it the new Y.O.L.O. or something, but it doesn't have enough personality or catchiness to do so. Well, I'm the Rap Critic!

Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town

I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here

Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm

'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes

You show me a signpost for where I should go

I see a mountain at my gates

Ah, each day I see you less

Yeah, when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go

Through lanes and stone rows
Black granite, wind blows
Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again
Dark clouds gather 'round
Will I run or stand my ground?

Oh, when I come to climb
Show me the mountain so far behind
Yeah, it's farther away
Its shadow gets smaller day after day

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street

I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it

Feeling like a digit in a system, just another stupid number
I don't know, know, know
Everything is twisted I can feel it
It's another stupid summer where it's cold, cold, cold
And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
A rocket full of liquor and a Polaroid for pictures
Baby, you should stop me before I lose control

How imperfect a person am I
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars; what do they see?

If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)

And dun-dun-dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn, just admit it
And dun-dun-dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn, don't you get it?

Got your finger on the trigger and you aiming at the mirror
Don't you shoot that ain't you, nah
'Cause on the outside you pretend but you hurting in the inner
What's the truth, what's the truth now?

How imperfect a person am I
Go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars; what do they see?

If I was the question, would you be my answer?
If I was the music, would you be the dancer?
If I was the student, would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner, would you be the preacher?
Would you be my (What?) (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it (Dun-dun-dun)
I still got a lot of shit to learn, I'll admit it

Yeah, cheers to the fact that you're living in, this is your world
They say they ain't feeling you, they living' in the old world
Word to my old girl, and word to me too
I only say it and I might because I need to
Feeling like I'm see-through and life is a window
I be runnin' opposite the way that the wind blow
You pick up the pieces of the things that you didn't know
So when you hear the top you better scream that you been though

Sat back with the window down
Eighty an hour and the radio loud
The same songs with the same old rhymes
Tell me to shake it off and swing from the lights

But I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made
You sent this hurricane, now it won't go away
And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy
Darling, please believe me

'Cause lovin' you, lovin' you is too hard
All I do, all I do is not enough

I cannot be lovin' you, lovin' you
Lovin' you, lovin' you leaves me hurt

Count stacks of the routine lies
Funny how easy you could see my blindside
Still the same songs with the same old beats
Sure, I could stay, but there's a place I'd rather be

And I can't help but drive away from all the mess you made

And I promised I'd be there, but you don't make it easy

Well, I'm just a boy with a broken toy
All lost and coy at the curtains of the waterfall
So it's here I stand as a broken man
But I've found my friend at the curtains of the waterfall
Now I'm falling down through the crashing sound
And you've come around at the curtains of the waterfall
And you rush to me and it sets us free
So I fall to my knees at the curtains of the waterfall

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

I hate the bar (IGH!)

Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights, mm, that I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love

If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club

We can still party hard in your birthday suit

If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place

Tell her friend to join in both ways

To go over everything

But I ain't done much healin'

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Where nothing ever happened?

Are running out of time

I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh, yeah

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up

لم نعد نتحدث، لم نعد نتحدث
لم نعد نتحدث كما كنا نفعل
نحن لا نضحك بعد الآن
لماذا كان كل ذلك؟
أووه، لم نعد نتحدث كما كنا نفعل

سمعت للتو أنك وجدتِ الشخص الذي كنتِ تبحثين
الذي كنتِ تبحثين عنه
أتمنى لو كنت أعرف أنه لست أنا
لأنه حتى بعد كل هذا الوقت، مازلت أتساءل
لماذا لا أستطيع تجاوز الأمر
مثلما فعلتِ أنتِ بسهولة

لا أريد أن أعرف
ما نوع الفستان الذي ترتديه الليلة
إذا كان هو ممسكًا بك بإحكام
مثلما فعلت أنا من قبل
لقد أفرطت بالحب
كان يجب أن أعرف أن حبك كان مجرد لعبة
الآن لا أستطيع إخراجك من تفكيري
أووه، ياله من أمر مخزي

أننا لم نعد نتحدث، لم نعد نتحدث

لماذا كان كل ذلك؟
أووه، لم نعد نتحدث كما كنا نفعل

أتمنى فقط أنك مستلقي بجانب شخصًا ما
من يعرف كيف يحبك مثلي
لابد أن يكون هناك سبب وجيه لرحيلك
بين الحين والآخر، أعتقد أنك قد تريد مني
أن آتي وأظهر عند بابك
لكنني خائفة جدًا من أن معتقدي خاطىء

لا أريد أن أعرف
إذا كنت تنظر إلى عينيها مباشرة
إذا كانت هي ممسكه بك بإحكام
مثلما فعلت أنا من قبل
لقد أفرطت بالحب
كان يجب أن أعرف أن حبك كان مجرد لعبة
الآن لا أستطيع إخراجك من تفكيري

أووه، لم نعد نتحدث كما كنا نفعل
كما كنا نفعل

لا أريد أن أعرف
ما نوع الفستان الذي ترتديه الليلة
إذا كان يمنحك الحب بطريقة صحيحة
مثلما فعلت أنا من قبل
لقد أفرطت بالحب
كان يجب أن أعرف أن حبك كان مجرد لعبة
الآن لا أستطيع إخراجك من تفكيري
أووه، ياله من أمر مخزي

'Cause I ignored the truth

Look at how things changed

I tried hard to make you want me
But we're not supposed to be
And the truth will always haunt me
Even though it set me free
And my tears flow like the ocean
As they floated in the breeze
They were falling in slow motion
And they brought me to my knees

You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll, ooh, yeah
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you
I'll, I'll, I'll get over you

When did you lose your emotion?
When did you become so cruel?
And if you want to cut me open
Says a thousand words 'bout you
And in time I know you'll leave me
Like a distant memory
I know love can be so easy
If I start by loving me, oh

You're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain
Turn off the light and now all that remains
Fills me with doubt
And I'm shouting your name out loud
Why do you wanna put me through the pain?
I get the feeling I'll never escape
I can't hide away from the shame of you
Woah-oh-oh

Tears on the ground, tears on my pillow
You won't bring me down

I'll get over you
I'll get over you

Tears on the ground, rain at my window
The pain washes out
And I'll get over you
These tears will get me through
And I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I don't need you to call me tonight
I don't need you to see if I'm alright
You left me, so leave me, I'm fine
I'll be here getting on with my life

Sorry, I ain't got no money

"i hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o'brien)",Garrett Nash,"1 ContributorI hate u, i love u (feat. olivia o’brien) - Deepend Remix Lyrics
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that
I type a text, but thеn I never mind that
I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

'Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Ooh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul (Ah)
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me

A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
'Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah

Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go apeshit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy

But don't want to work for it — tell me now, isn't it funny? (Nah)

You got a fast car

Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk

See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation

On a crowded street

We’re just strangers in passing casually
It’s not us no more

Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love

We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though

But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb

So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n

You can be my guiding light
Keep me company in the night
That's all I need, all I want
Is for you to stay a little longer now
With arms around me, like a border
Like the air I breathe, I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
Cause I'm

Giving in to your touch
I can never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

You can be my safety zone
Somewhere I can go when I feel alone
That's all I need, all I want

Arms around me like a border
Like an endless stream

To a place that I've never been
Now I'm

I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years older
But fuck it, it was somethin' to do

I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

Never really knowin' why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that rollercoaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowin' who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singin', stuck up on that stage singin'

Of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
No, you don't wanna be high like me

Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It’s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
It’s so hard
So hard

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

And I know that it’s wrong
That I can’t move on
But there’s something about you

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand

And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality

And Lost Boys like me are free

Uh-huh, hoo

We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

I hate the bar (IGH!)
Pharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic
Took the car (IGH!)

But I done seen how the *censored* did my main man (Main man)

Dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
Nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)
Nigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
The rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan

Hope you hear what I'm saying

And I hate this club

Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red (Woo!)

Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights
When the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here
With the vultures, hissing and circling
You didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)

Ooh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you (IGH!)

All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club

Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them

Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year""
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it moving, now, tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one

Is you a real one?

¡Oye!
Bueno, nada nunca dura para siempre, no
Un minuto estás aquí y al siguiente ya no
Así que, te respeto, quieres ir despacio
Necesito un recibo mental para saber que este momento me pertenece

¿Te importa si te robo un beso? -¡Vamos!- (Chop, chop)
Un pequeño recuerdo, ¿te lo puedo robar?
Para memorizar la forma en que me conmocionaste
La forma en que te movías (Hey)
Solo quiero sentirlo de ti (Hey)

No tengas miedo a enamorarte
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Hey)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Hey)
Bebé, sé que no tienes miedo a enamorarte
Enamorarte de mí

Soy tu ""quiero y no puedo"", adicto a tu amor, oh
Llevo puestas tus gafas, realidad virtual
No es lo que te han costado, puede que haya sido un dólar
Siempre y cuando haga que te sacudas, memoria, electricidad

¿Te importa si te robo un beso? -¡Vamos!- (Chop, chop)
Un pequeño recuerdo, ¿te lo puedo robar? (Oh, sí)
Para memorizar la forma en que me conmocionaste (Zap)

Solo quiero sentirlo de ti (Hey)

No tengas miedo a enamorarte (Ha)
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Hey)
Bebé, sé que no tienes miedo a enamorarte (Inmediatamente)
Enamorarte de mí (Woah)

Maldita sea, sé que te encanta hacer una entrada triunfal
¿Te gusta que te paguen o que te presten atención?
Mezclaste a los tipos equivocados con buenas intenciones
En la misma cama, pero aún parece que hay una larga distancia
Ella está buscando algo más de consistencia
Pero cuando dejas de buscar, vas a encontrar lo que estaba destinado a ser
Y sinceramente, estoy muy harto de las putas
Me he desecho de todas mis ex por tus besos y abrazos
Creo que mis viejas aventuras amorosas me estaban simplemente preparando
Cuando digo que te quiero, di tú lo mismo, periquito
Volamos en primera clase por el aire, Airbnb
Soy lo mejor que has tenido, solo me estarías comparando conmigo mismo
Te voy a enviar esto por email, si te pongo en mi teléfono
Y lo subo, recibiré el número máximo de reproducciones
Vine cruzando dificultades con los labiales y los teléfonos
Llevo tu colonia favorita solo para tenerte a solas

No tengas miedo a enamorarte
No tengas miedo a enamorarte
Conduce un descapotable y persigue emociones (Yeah)
Sé que no tienes miedo de esto (Lo sé)

Se quitó las panties, los diamantes bailan como Rick Ricardo

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look

Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Ayağa kalkıp koca götünü Gucci pantolonuma koydu

Şişeler istediğini söyledi, masamız yok

Bu herhangi biri ve herkes için
Oh, Tanrım! Bana her gün yazıyor, cevap alamıyor
Kaltak, tepemi attırıyorsun
Bu altını bronza çevirmek gibi bir şey, gözlerimi deviriyorum
Ve o Molly kullandığı zaman zombiye dönüşüyor
O bizim Clyde ve Bonnie olduğumuzu düşünüyor
Tanrım, beni affet! Tunechi F akıyorum, ben bir efsaneyim

Drehe mich und es ist nass, als käme es aus Maytag

Denn du hast es geschlagen wie die 68er-Jets

Ich hab gehört, sie hat diese anderen Niggas zum Durchdrehen gebracht
Ja, ich behandle dich wie eine Lady, Lady

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover I'd never lie
He said, ""Be true,"" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Uh, got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my **** (Hahaha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents
She'd be down for whatever, never gotta convince, you know?

'Member this for when I die
Everybody dressed in all black, suits and a tie, my funeral will be lit if I
Ever go down or get caught, or they identify
My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie
See, that's my down bitch, see, that's my soldier
She keeps that thang-thang if anyone goes there
Calm and collected, she keeps her composure
And she gon' ride for me until this thing over
We do drugs together, fuck up clubs together
And we'd both go crazy if we was to sever, you know?
We keep mobbin', it's just me and my bitch
Fuck the world, we just gon' keep getting rich, you know?

Don't come any closer
I've seen how this all works
So when you tell me lies
Look me in the eyes first
I'm just trying to protect my heart
Showed you every single scar
Say, ""It's you, not me""
'Cause that's my favorite part

Why does it hurt so much?
With every single touch, we thought this was love
Why do I want to stay numb?
I want to be alone, I just don't know how
Why does it hurt so much?
With every single touch, we thought this was love
Why do I want to stay numb? (Numb, numb, numb)

If I'm never lonely, I won't ever feel the pain
Love me in the morning anyways, anyways

If I'm never lonely, I won't ever feel the pain
Love me in the morning anyways, anyways

I saw it in your eyes
Baby blue, like the sky
And all these puzzled games you played
Fucking with my mind, you would never stay (Never stay)
I saw it coming soon
'Cause when you looked at me she would look at you
Say, ""It's you, not me""
'Cause that's my favorite part

Why does it hurt so much?
With every single touch, we thought this was love
Why do I want to stay numb?
I want to be alone, I just don't know how
Why does it hurt so much?

Maldición, amor o lujuria
Maldición, todos nosotros

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere
(¡Otro estreno mundial!)
Así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
Bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
Solo ámame
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Ámame
Quiero estar contigo
Ámame, solo ámame

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Ayy, tengo algo
Espera, nosotros funcionamos sin suposiciones
Me siento como Tyson con eso
Golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
Solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
Solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
Solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
Golpea ese hombro delgado
Sé lo que significa
De espalda a altamar
Sé lo que necesitas
Ya en diez, todo el dinero entra
Todo sentimiento sale, este sentimiento no se seca
Esta fiesta no terminará

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere
Así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
Bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
Solo ámame
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Ámame
Quiero estar contigo
Ámame, solo ámame

Estoy en camino
No tenemos tiempo que perder
Explota tu chicle en el camino (ámame)
¿Estoy en el camino?
No quiero presionarte
Quiero tu bendición hoy (ámame)
Oh, por cierto, abre la puerta por el camino
Te dije que estoy en camino (ámame)
Estoy en camino, sé que la conexión es vaga
Levanta el teléfono para mí, bebé
Maldición, interferimos
La mala actitud de tu abuela
Las curvas y caderas de tu abuela
Recuerda Gardena, tomé la cámara de estudio
Sé que Top estará enojado conmigo
Tuve que hacerlo, quiero tu cuerpo, tu música
Compré un anillo para probarlo
Mira lo que hiciste
Te dije que estoy en camino
Soy como un camino de salida, sí

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again, like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead Redemption, scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on sale motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

Dostum, sikeyim
Sorun ne Kyle?
Dostum, bu çocuklar, boş boş konuşup sinirimi bozuyorlar
Aga, sikeyim o çocukları, hayatına bak aga, etrafına bak
Dostum.. Haklısın
Hmm, şuradaki sağlam orospuları görüyor musun?
Vay, evet
Şu ağaçları görüyor musun? Peki ya şu suyu?
Sanırım sorun falan yok
Hadi ama kardeşim, şükretmen gereken çok şey var
Aga.. Düşündüm de.. Haklısın
Çok haklısın ki çok haklıyım. Çok haksız olduğum bir gün bile hatırlamıyorum
Sağol Lil Boat, dostum
Kanka, bu yüzden buradayım

Son zamanlarda kafayı bulmuyordum...
Pekala, belki biraz bebeğim, yalan söylemek istemiyorum
Bana mesaj attığında, kızım, her zaman cevap vermiyorum biliyorum
Sen bir melek değilsin, uçamıyorsun bile
Fark ediyorum ki, bir şeyler bildiğini sanıyorsun
Tüm bu hayaletler bana doğru geliyor, kimin fırlattığını merak ediyorum
Vizyonu göremiyorlar, dostum dikkatlari dağılmış olmalı
Bu gerçekten güzel bir albüm ahbap, kim yazdı merak ediyorum, oh lanet olsun
Tamam, o zencilerin gitmesini diliyorum
Cirque Du Soleil gibi her zaman etrafta palyaçolar var
Bu bir albüm değil, hatta bunlar sadece gelişi güzeller
Bu şey çok soğuk, piyasaya sürüldüğünde kar günü olacak
Ayy, o iyi ve bunu biliyor, söylemiyor, sadece gösteriyor
Ben tıpkı DeRozan gibiyim, shoot atarsam girer
Cali'de güneşleniyorum, onlar o kadar ıslanıyor ki kızağa ihtiyaçları var
Oprah ile selfie'im var, sadece paylaşasım yok
Mutlu mekanımda takılıyorum, 2006' dan beri somurtmuyorum
2001' den beri ağlamıyorum, benim mekanım Six Flags gibi ve senin evin
Hiç eğlenceli değil
Benimkine geri de gelebilirsin, arkadaşın tatlı değil
Fakat sorun değil
Yüksek notada bitireceğiz

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver

Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Gözlüyorum, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Oh ben...

21 yaşında olduğunu söylüyor, kimlik görmem gerek
Bütün orospularım çift çift geliyor aşağıdaki taşaklarım gibi
Bir Hatchback'te şehri turladığım günleri hatırlıyorum
Genç goblinlerimle bir sorun arıyoruz
Modelimi evine boynundaki ağrılarla gönderiyorum
O kadar çok para kazandım ki durdurulamıyor
Kardeşlerim soyadım gibi yanımdadır
Herkese evcilleşmeyeceğimi söylediğim zamanlar aklımda
Woah, altı ay sonra ters döndüm ve şimdi oyundayım
Sahte zincir kolyelerden bambaşka seviyelerde elmaslar
""Beni buradan alabilir misiniz?"" sveiyesinden buraya geldim
Beni siklemeyen bir sürü insanı hatırlıyorum
Üniversiteye gittiler, şimdi hepsi tarih oldu
Dişimdeki altını elmasa dönüştürdüm
Arabamızda sert takılıyoruz, gizemli şeyler peşindeyiz (Raggy!)
Beni siklememeye devam et
Uzun zamandır lüks içinde yaşıyorum, hayır
Boat ve Kyle piyano tuşları gibi birbirinden ayrılmaz
Anneannemin üstüne yemin ederim ki asla bir orospuyu kondomsuz sikmem

Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir
Dur, bu hep, sonsuzluk anlamına geliyor, bekle, boş ver
Oh, küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Küçük gözümle gözlüyorum
Elde edebileceğim bir kız çünkü çok fazla beğeni almıyor
Kıvırcık tatlı bir kız, karım olabilir

And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?

You got everything to give right now

Un paio di piloti ribelli
Stanno volando ma non devono essere da nessuna parte
Non ti conosco molto bene
Ma penso che potremmo essere simili
Ci comportiamo in modo anomalo

Lasciamo che le cose escano dalla falegnameria
Ti mostrerò il mio lato migliore, ti dirò le mie migliori bugie
Si, fantastico, vero?
Allora lasciamo che le cose escano dalla falegnameria
Ti mostrerò il mio lato migliore, ti dirò le mie migliori bugie
Mi vedi rotolare, amare qualcun altro
Balliamo senza le scarpe
Sai che penso che tu sia fantastico, vero?

Le nostre regole, i nostri sogni, siamo ciechi
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa
I nostri amici, i nostri drink, ci ispiriamo
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa

Voglio sentire la luce, spingiamo i nostri limiti
Slacciato per la corsa, mhmm
Siamo lontano di casa
Siamo onesti con noi stessi
Siamo troppo in alto per guidare
Prendiamoci la notte
Se la luce è nel cielo
Aperto, finalmente, andiamo e siamo liberi

Le nostre regole, i nostri sogni, siamo ciechi
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa
I nostri amici, i nostri drink, ci ispiriamo
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa

Ho fermato la tua ragazza alla porta
Ho detto al tuo amico di andare al negozio
È solo io e te, finalmente noi due
Non mi pento di aver bevuto questo liquore, ti faccio ascoltare
Si, so che non mi conosci bene
La mia ragazza è alla porta
Ho lasciato la mia cautela a casa
Non torno indietro

Le nostre regole, i nostri sogni, siamo ciechi
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa
I nostri amici, i nostri drink, ci ispiriamo
Stiamo facendo saltare la merda con dinamite fatta in casa

Camminiamo, non cadiamo mai, ma corriamo ancora
Allora, versi, versi un'altra bibita
So che stiamo facendo qualcosa
Abbiamo, abbiamo una pistola carica
Vai e mostrami lo sguardo nei tuoi occhi
Sei qui, sono tuo, tu sei mio
Ci troviamo quando siamo pazzi
Poi ci prendiamo tutto
Sei un treno in corsa, si
Mi fai sentire alto
Non voglio inseguirlo, no
Sai che penso che tu sia fantastico, vero?

Le nostre regole, i nostri sogni, siamo ciechi

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool

Oh-oh, oh, no, oh, no, oh
¡Hey, yeah!
Diri-diri-diririri, Daddy, go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡DY!)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (Oh)

Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo, se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube), ah (Sube, sube)

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito', favorito', baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh; woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido (Rrr; DY)

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo (Eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (Eh), mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (Eh-eh; ¡plo!)
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamo' pegando, poquito a poquito (Oh-oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (No, no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza, oye (Yo, yo; ¡plo!)

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (Yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (Yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo (Plo, plo)

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh, woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay, bendito!""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo

Am I out of my head? Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say? It's complicated
Don't matter what you say, don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good (So good), that you can't explain it
What can I say? It's complicated (Ayy)

Nothing's that bad if it feels good
So you come back like I knew you would
And we're both wild and the night's young
And you're my drug, breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum, I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tat, eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips while my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life and you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever, uh (Yeah)

I can't explain it, I love the pain (Ayy, ayy)
And I love the way that your breath numbs me like novocaine
And we are always high (Ooh), keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane, but you the same
Let me paint the picture, uh (Yeah), couch by the kitchen, ayy (Yeah)
Nothin' but your heels on, losin' our religion (Mm)
You're my pretty little vixen and I'm that voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever, even when we're not together (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever, like (Ayy, ayy)
I want you forever, even when we're not together (Oh)

And when we touch, I'm shivering

You know I'm back, like I never left (I never left)
Another sprint, another step (Another step)
Another day, another breath (Another breath)
Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)
I got a new attitude and a lease on life and some peace of mind
Seek and I find, I can sleep when I die
Want a piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight, I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people, or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus, searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (Oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (Been going in)
Since we hopped out that DeLorean (DeLorean, yeah we win)
En garde, things are just things, they don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like ""Woo, that boy got bars""
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, won't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came, woo

Cold (feat. Future),Maroon 5,"2 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishMaroon 5 - Cold ft. Future (Tradução em Português) Lyrics

Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que eu não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo
A cada respiração sua
Eu percebo que tem algo acontecendo
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria
Nós estamos dando um tempo ou terminando?
Não consigo entender as entrelinhas
Me pedindo por espaço aqui na minha casa
Você sabe como ferrar comigo
Agindo como se não estivéssemos juntos
Depois de tudo que passamos juntos
Dormindo sobre segredos
Como posso estar tão longe de você?
Distante, quando estamos nos beijando
Parece tão diferente
Querida, me diga como você ficou

Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que eu não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo
A cada respiração sua
Eu percebo que tem algo acontecendo
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria, sim

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria
Pelo que você está esperando, esperando?
Se quer ir embora, apenas vá
Por que você está mordendo a língua?
O silêncio está acabando comigo
Agindo como se não estivéssemos juntos
Se não quer isso, então pra que continuar?
Dormindo sobre segredos
Como posso estar tão longe de você?
Distante (oh), quando estamos nos beijando (sim)
Parece tão diferente (sim)
Querida, me diga como você ficou
Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que eu não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo

Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria, sim

Ooh, yeah
(Tão fria, é um mundo frio)
Ooh, yeah
(Tão fria, é um mundo frio)
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria

Nunca pensei que você fosse assim
Tirei a etiqueta e te fiz impagável
Acabei de gastar meio milhão em um lustre
Agora você tenta me desligar como um interruptor, sim
Tentando ficar, e eu vou embora
Dizendo que precisa de um tempo para respirar
Pensando que eu estou dormindo na palavra de quatro letras
Mas a palavra de quatro letras não dorme
Estamos indo por dois caminhos diferentes
Você não tem agido como sempre
Você tem que ir, mas onde costumava ficar seu coração
Você tenta preencher com ouro todos os dias
Eu mudei as quatro portas por duas portas
Porque não posso deixar meu motorista ouvir o que você diz
Garota, eu tentei te dar espaço

Querida, me diga como você ficou tão
Fria o bastante para arrepiar meus ossos
Parece que não te conheço mais
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria comigo
Com cada respiração que você respira
Percebo que tem algo acontecendo
Não entendo o porquê de você estar tão fria

Breathing in the dark, lying on its side
The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

Oh, forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone on the stage, my little dark age

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Oh, I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange
I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing

All alone, horrified on the stage, my little dark age

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind

Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed, come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone, all the rage, my little dark age

I know that if you hide, it doesn't go away
If you get out of bed and find me standing

I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Start flipping for my enemies
Or we could wait until the walls come down

But, oh, until it falls, won't bother me

Is it coming back?

Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over

He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted

Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück' dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben

Kommst an dein Limit
Sagst, du kommst an dein Limit
Gehst über dein Limit

Macht dich süchtig nach meinem Körper
Nimmt dich über und unter und verdreht wie Origami

Die Art wie du läufst, die Art wie du redest
Ich werfe es dir vor, denn es ist alles deine Schuld
Du spielst hart, turn mich nicht ab
Du spielst hart, aber ich weiß, du bist weich
Du bist mein Fetisch, ich bin voll dabei
All diese Gerüchte, die verbreitet werden
Könnte es genauso gut machen und einfach kommen
Weil sie sagen, wir hätten es schon getan
Wende dich an Gucci, wenn du mich jemals brauchst
Ich werde am South Beach im glänzenden Cabrio sein
Wasser Diamanten, Aquafina
Brauche dich nur im blauen Bikini

Du hast einen Fetisch für meine Liebe
Ich drück' dich weg, doch du kommst sofort wieder
Sehe keinen Grund, dir dafür die Schuld zu geben
Wenn ich du wäre, würde ich auch Sex mit mir haben

Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes

I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy

Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)

And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you woulda learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though? Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I coulda did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stopped so abrupt, you started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)

Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check

You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)

Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

So I cut you off
I don't need your love

River (feat. Ed Sheeran),Eminem,"7 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishTürkçeРусский (Russian)PortuguêsفارسیTürkçeEminem - River ft. Ed Sheeran (Deutsche Übersetzung) Lyrics

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

Er kommt heim mit zerkratztem Hals, um Kritik einzustecken
Sweatjacke und Anzughose, nicht zusammenpassend
In seinem Atem Jack, er ist ein Sexsüchtiger
Und sie möchte nur Rache üben und zurückkommen
Es ist ein Schachspiel, sie ist hinter ihm her wie ein Jetpack
Sie behält die Übersicht über all seine Internetchats
Und ratet, wer gerade dabei ist, zur Nächsten weiterzuziehen
Tatsächlich, gerade auf mein letztes Mädchen gekackt und sie hat, was meiner Ex fehlt
Denn sie liebt Gefahr, Psychopath
Und du fickst mit niemandes Mädchen, selbst ich weiß das
Aber sie hat einen Plan entwickelt, ihm in den Rücken zu stechen
Messer in der Hand, sagt, dass ihre Beziehung an einer Strähne hängt
Also war sie neuerdings im Netz
Sagt, vielleicht wird sie meine Gwen Stacy sein, um ihren Mann zu ärgern
Und ich weiß, sie benutzt mich, um zu versuchen, ihn zu betrügen, mir egal
Hi Suzanne, aber ich hätte sagen sollen: „Bye Suzanne“
Nach der ersten Nacht, aber heute Nacht bin ich

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

One-Night-Stand, wurde zu einem Two-Night-Stand
Es war „Komm, Sonnenlicht, verschwinde“, jetzt umarmen wir uns fest und...

Er hat es rausgefunden, jetzt fühlt sie sich verlassen und benutzt
Denn er ist abgehauen, na und? Er hat es ihr außerdem zuerst angetan
Wie soll ich jetzt diesem Mädchen sagen, dass wir fertig sind?
Es ist hart, die Worte zu finden, ich bin reserviert, nervös, und Sue
Möchte nicht, dass das wehtut, aber was du verdienst ist die Wahrheit
Nimm es nicht persönlich, ich kann es dir einfach nicht persönlich sagen
Also kehre ich ins Studio zurück, wie Rattenloch-Diner
Muss in einer Kabine nicht reserviert sein
Ich fühle mich nur so, als wäre die Person, zu der ich werde
Unumkehrbar, ich habe auf dich Jagd gemacht, als wäre es Kirche auf der Kirchenbank
Und jetzt, wo ich dich habe, will ich dich nicht
Nutzte den Vorteil in meinem Verfolgungsdurst
Warum mache ich diesen Dreck, den ich mache?
Steige auf meine Tribüne und predige meine Predigt und Rede
Reinigungsmittel und Bleiche verbrennen die Wunde
Denn jetzt, mit ihr im Mutterleib
Können wir sie nicht in diese Welt bringen, hätten daran denken sollen
Schutz zu verwenden, bevor ich in deine verbotene Frucht gebissen habe
Fuck!

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines, ich möchte nichts zugeben
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist
Wahrheit und meine Lügen fallen grade wie der Regen
Also lass den Fluss strömen

Mein Name ist (ooh), mein Name ist (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), Fluss ströme
Nennt mich (ooh), nennt mich (ooh)
Fluss (ooh), wir werden den Fluss strömen lassen

Immer die Brautjunger, niemals „die Braut, hey“
Was zum Teufel soll ich sagen? Wenn das Leben eine Schnellstraße wäre
Und Betrug eine Enklave, würde ich über fünf Fahrspuren schlingern
Die Geschwindigkeit ist enorm, als würde ich auf Eis rutschen, vielleicht
Ist das, warum ich dich vielleicht von der Seite angemacht habe
Ich kann meine Lügen nicht beisammen halten
Aber ich brachte dich dazu, mein Baby aufzulösen
Diese Dreiecksbeziehung ließ uns im Ruin zurück, verwirrt
Was kann ich noch sagen? Es hat eine Zeit lang Spaß gemacht
Wette, ich hätte dein Lächeln wirklich geliebt
Wollte nicht wirklich abtreiben, aber scheiß drauf
Was ist eine Lüge mehr, die wir unserem ungeborenen Kind erzählen?

Ich bin ein Lügner gewesen, ein Dieb gewesen
Ein Liebhaber gewesen, ein Betrüger gewesen
All meine Sünden brauchen heiliges Wasser, fühle es mich überspülen
Also, Kleines (es tut mir leid)
Ich möchte nichts zugeben (ich habe es vermasselt)
Wenn alles, was es bringt, Schmerz ist

Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean

If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone

And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

Maldición, amor o lujuria
Maldición, todos nosotros

Dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
No hay nadie, nadie que me supere
(¡Otro estreno mundial!)
Así que dame una oportunidad por mi dinero
Bebiendo champán, sintiendo con amor, viviendo con amor
Solo ámame
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Solo ámame, solo ámame, solo ama
Quiero estar contigo, ayy, quiero estar con...
Ámame
Quiero estar contigo
Ámame, solo ámame

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme
Mantenlo al cien: no te tengo, no tengo nada

Ayy, tengo algo
Espera, nosotros funcionamos sin suposiciones
Me siento como Tyson con eso
Golpéalo dos veces, estoy con eso
Solo por la noche, estoy bromeando
Solo por la vida, sí, solo por la vida, sí
Solo por la vida, sí, consigamoslo
Golpea ese hombro delgado
Sé lo que significa
De espalda a altamar
Sé lo que necesitas
Ya en diez, todo el dinero entra
Todo sentimiento sale, este sentimiento no se seca
Esta fiesta no terminará

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?
Si minimizo mi patrimonio neto, ¿todavía me amarías?
Mantente constante, preferiría que confíes en mí antes que amarme

Estoy en camino

Explota tu chicle en el camino (ámame)
¿Estoy en el camino?
No quiero presionarte
Quiero tu bendición hoy (ámame)
Oh, por cierto, abre la puerta por el camino
Te dije que estoy en camino (ámame)
Estoy en camino, sé que la conexión es vaga
Levanta el teléfono para mí, bebé
Maldición, interferimos
La mala actitud de tu abuela
Las curvas y caderas de tu abuela
Recuerda Gardena, tomé la cámara de estudio
Sé que Top estará enojado conmigo
Tuve que hacerlo, quiero tu cuerpo, tu música
Compré un anillo para probarlo
Mira lo que hiciste
Te dije que estoy en camino
Soy como un camino de salida, sí

Si no tengo frenos sobre la acera, ¿todavía me amarías?

Just to let a little trouble, knock me out of my position
And interrupt the vision
After everything I witnessed, after all of these decisions
All these miles, feet, inches
They can't add up to the distance
That I have been through, just to get to
A place where even if there's no closure, I'm still safe
I still ache from tryin' to keep pace
Somebody give me a sign, I'm startin' to lose faith

Now tell me, how did all my dreams turn to nightmares?
How did I lose it when I was right there?
Now I'm so far that it feels like it's all gone to pieces

Just a bit
You broke my heart (Ow my heart)

Don’t come with those stories anymore baby
If from the beginning I was for you
They never warned me about what the problem was
You like to be rolling in other people’s beds
Now it’s my turn to change the system
Hang around new babes, give away my heart
Without much sorrow, now I tell you goodbye
Thank you so much, there’s none for you

Uooh uooh uohh, uooh uooh uohh
I’m not afraid to say goodbye
I want to give away my heart

Thank you so much, there’s none for you

But my love there isn’t a problem, no, no

Who will say hold a grudge?

I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes, when we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind, not the fire that we begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened, I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute

This just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls and I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else, well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now, if we jump together, at least we can swim far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind 'cause

I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but

I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everythin' I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoyin'
I just wanna make you feel like everythin' I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything, you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walkin' towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?

You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothin's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothin' left right now, I gave it all to you

Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work and prolly woulda figured things out
But, I guess I'm a letdown
But, it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughin'?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but, at least you're happy

Baby, la vida e' un ciclo (Wuh)
Y lo que no sirve yo no lo reciclo (No)
Así que de mi vida muévete
Que si te lo meto e' pa' recordar un T.B.T., yeh (Yeh)

Todo tiene su final, todo expira (Yeh)
Tú ere' pasado y el pasado nunca vira

Lo que pide e' un perreo sucio en La Placita

Dale, prende un Phillie, deja uno ready pa' ahorita, yeh (¡Brr!)

Odio saber que en ti una ve' má' yo confié
Odio to' lo' ""te amo"" que mil vece' te texteé
Baby, mejor que tú, ahora tengo como die'

Y a tu amiga me clavé, me la clavé
Fuck you, hijo 'e puta, yeh (¡Huh!)

Dostlarım mahallene uğradığında o silahın gra-ta-ta-ta gibi patlayacağından emin olacaklar

Tarzımı değiştirdim, siyahlar içerisinde geldim

Kapıyı kapat, tüttürüyoruz
Benden çakmak istedi beni Morrisson sanıyor (Ayy)
Sahnede aptal gibi davran
Büyük ihtimalle şovumdan polis arabası ile ayrılacaksın
Efsaneviydi, Montage'ın tepesinden televizyonu aşağı fırlattı
Masanın üstünde Kokain var, likör karışıyor hiçbir şey umrumuzda değil
Dostum, kız arkadaşın bir sürtük içeri girmeye uğraşıyor
""Ben gruptanım"" diyor (Ayy, ayy)
Kafayı yemiş gibi davranmaya başladı pantolonlarımdan tutmaya çalışıyor

Arkadan vur, saçlarından çek
""Yeter artık"" diye bağırıyor (Evet, evet, evet)

Blindfolded minds collide and we fall

When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our story's after the end

Like strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

Too easy to rewrite
Left as lonely shadows
Holding each other tight and we fall

Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you

And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station (Selling petrol)
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly, but you need some imagination

And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

I can't stop sweating or control my feet
Got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

It's true that all I do is sit and think about you

All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose, then I lose

سر خوردم توی یه برنامه  عشق و حال با زنگ دوست دخترم
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
کلی گنگستر ،  کلی دختر و یه گردن بند آیسی چِین دور گردنم
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
چرا ادعا میکنی ثروتمندی؟ ادعات دروغی بیش نیست
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
سریع مثل شلاق زدن آماده میشم و وسایلم و چمدونم رو جمع نمیکنم : 1 معنی
توی صف دریافت چمدون نمیرم (با جت شخصی خودم سفر میکنم)ا : 2 معنی
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
کلی لباس های برند و استایل دارم که حتی نمیشه اسمشونو تلفظ کرد
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
تو هیچ برند و استایل خاصی نداری ، توی اینستاگرام میبینمت

I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
یه جوری تکونش میدم که مثل یه چیز تازه از ماهیتابه میپره بیرون

Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone

The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go

And still the memory's right there

No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh

Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've been undone

Oh, Saturday Sun

I can't handle it now

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going 'round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel, then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want ya""

One minute, you say we're a team

But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need

There you go, there, I said it
Don't look at me all offended
You played games 'til it ended
I've got to look out for me
I won't say that it's easy
Oh, I know I hate leaving
But you can't keep deceiving
Does it make you feel good?

I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up

Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for, I've been up for

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you in MIA for

Money In The Grave (Drake ft. Rick Ross),Drake,"3 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishEspañolУкраїнськаPortuguêsDeutschDrake - Money In The Grave ft. Rick Ross (Türkçe Çeviri) Lyrics
Peki, tamam
Lil CC beat'te, mmh
Aynen, aynen

Yani şimdi nereden başlasam ki ulan?
Gizli tuttuğum kaltaklarım var
Sokağın karşısında yaşayan zencilerim var
Eskiyi düşündüm de onlar öldü
Raplerimin gerçek olmadığını sandılar, ta ki barlarla yerlerine oturana kadar
İki telefonum var, birinin şarj olması gerek
Aynen, onlar ikiz ama götlerini ayırt edebilirim
Bana gelen büyük paketler var
Kasadan çıkan büyük paralar var
Yanımda Lil Max var, esaslı adamdır
Bu oyunda aramızda büyük bir boşluk var
Öteki hayatımda paralı kalmak istiyorum
Öldüğümde paramı mezara koyun

Öldüğümde paramı mezara koyun
Harbiden bazı zencileri yerine oturtmam lazım
Harbiden yarıştaki her zenciyi turladım
Harbiden yazdırmalıyım ""En Gerçekçi Zenci"" diye suratıma
Lil CC vur şunu bass'la
Eskiden kurtarırdım sürtükleri maske ve pelerinle
Şimdiyse, ""Hayır canım, böyle iyiyim, uzaklaş""
Parasız ölmeyi düşünmüyorum adadım kendimi

O halt çok önemliyken tepedeydim
Hâlâ tepedeyim düşmekten korkar gibi
Hâlâ tepedeyim ve bu zenciler yer değiştirmek istiyor
Zenciler yer değiştirmek istiyor, Slauson veya Watts gibi
Değişmek istemiyorum çünkü olduğum yerde iyiyim
Mafya bağlantılarım var o yüzden olduğum yerde iyiyim
Selamlar olsun Junior'a, Jazzy'e, Baby J'e
Söyle onlara öldüğümde paramı mezara koysunlar

Birkaç parça var tetikçiler arayıp topluyorlar
Kız zencinin tekiyle yatıyor sonra sıradakine geçiyor
Geniş yaşıyor hovardanın tekine korkuyla bağlanmış
Siz zencilerse küçük düşünüyorsunuz mağazada bir gammazla
Takıl bizimle gerçekten istiyorsan onu
Sprinter'da yarım milyon kazanırsın
Telefonum çalıyor, kaltaklar biliyor büyük bahşişçiyimdir
Anlaşmayı sağladım ve sınır falan yok
Fakirlik zenci DNA'na işlemiş
Ricker Smiley Decatur'da kokoyla
Bücür zenci, başka bi' geçici iş

If you don't wanna see me

Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London (Yo)

I do deals, but I never get twanged (Twanged)
Moves that ain't ever been planned (Planned)
No goons that were never in gangs (Gangs)
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged (What?)
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (Hand)
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam (Glam)
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, ""Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown""
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a while)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, ""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs (It don't stop)
And you can do Glasto (Headline slot)
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home

Und sie spielt nicht mit einem anderen Mann
Und ich und sie haben etwas anderes
Ich brauche wirklich alles, was du verstehst
Dass niemand in der Nähe ist
Und ich will nie herumlaufen
Ich habe meine Jugend damit verbracht, ein- und auszuspringen
Du weißt, ich liebe sie jetzt
Wie niemand es jemals könnte

Und du weißt, ich bleibe stolpern, bin ich verrückt? Ach nein
Ich bleibe mit Sicherheit bei meinem Baby
Zusammen oder alleine

Dass sie nicht diejenige ist, mit der man spielt, oh nein

Dass sie sich nicht mit einem anderen Mann anlegen will
Nun, was wirst du nicht tun?
Steht da, 'kreuze mich an, als hättest du Kung-Fu
Todesstarren, Arm kreuzen, den Mund wie ein Wasserhahn laufen lassen
Aber du weißt nicht, dass mein Mädchen CrossFit gemacht hat
Pew, Kung Pow, schlag deinen Arsch mit einem Cross Kick
Zieh dir die Haare aus, zermürbe dich, du bist erschöpft
Weiß, dass sie immer rutschen wird, wenn du Scheiße sprichst
Halten Sie eine kleine Klinge in ihrem verdammten Lipgloss-Kit, ayy
Niemand sagt ""Hallo"" zu mir ohne sie
Zahle der Königin deinen Respekt
Mach das lieber ohne Flirt
Muss das HBIC respektieren

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

Tu agis comme si tu avais besoin d'un rappel
Essayant de recommencer ça
Mais toutes ces paillettes ne sont pas de l’or, j'étais aveuglée
Je n'aurais jamais dû te donner mon coeur
You act like you need remindin’
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

Et je ne peux pas croire que j'ai pu croire à tous ces mensonges
J'ai cru que tu étais miennе, mais pourtant tu as décidé d'être avec lui
Tu t'es еmparée de mes sentiments et tu les as juste jetés par la fenêtre
C'est comme si c'était trop dur de retomber amoureuse, non

Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, bébé, je ne peux pas m’empêcher de penser à nous
Je me le remémore, je bois, tu me manques
Est-ce que tu peux me dire pourquoi tout cet amour distant ?
Si j’appelais, est-ce que tu décrocherais ?
Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, je veux juste t'envoyer un message, mais à quoi bon ?
Tu vas dire que tu me veux, puis retourner ta veste
Juste jouer avec mes émotions juste parce que, non (Oh)

Toutes ces fois où j’ai fait l'imbécile pour toi
Pensant qu'on pourrait se remettre ensemble, pensant qu'on avait toute la vie devant nous
Tu n’as jamais vu ma perspective
Notre connexion est tellement endommagée, tu ne fais aucun effort

Et je ne peux pas croire que j'ai pu croire à tous ces mensonges
J'ai cru que tu étais mienne, mais pourtant tu as décidé d'être avec lui
Tu t'es emparée de mes sentiments et tu les as juste jetés par la fenêtre

Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, je veux juste t'envoyer un message, mais à quoi bon ?

Tu vas me donner des faux espoirs, meuf
Tu vas me donner des faux espoirs, meuf
Tu vas juste me dire encore plus de mensonges, meuf
Tu vas juste me donner des faux espoirs, meuf

J'ai été bien trop bon avec toi, tu m'as pris pour acquis
Tu étais mon premier jour depuis la fois à Big B's house sur Adams
Le premier jour où on s'est rencontré-e-s, je t'ai faite signe, je t'ai dit, ""Appelle-moi""

D.A. tem aquela droga!

Água gelada, virou Atlântica (Congelou)
De noite em um Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)
Falei pra essas putas não entrarem em pânico
Tomei uma ilha, (Yeah) inundou a mansão (Muita água)
Abaixei o teto, mais expansão
Dirija um carro em que você possa ficar (It's lit)
Vejo as vadias cobertas (Nos lençóis)
Eu sou um amante de bundas e peitos (Bunda grande)
Acho que todos nós fizemos um pro outro
Agora que todos os parças estão livres (Yeah, yeah)
E estamos fora nessas ruas (Tudo bem)
Você pode fazer isso, você pode rebolar pra mim?

Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)
Entrando em um Demon, por Deus (Por Deus)
Parece que eu ainda faço fraude (Fraude)
Voando no jato particular com uma arma (Arma)
Esse merda Z, essa merda Z (Essa merda Z)

Offset!
Explodi os miolos do carro (Boom)
A polícia quer falar, mas eu tô no mudo (Woo-woo, hey)
Vou cravejar o pulso dela porque ela é fofa (Ice, ice)
Transo com ela em um iate, mergulho numa piscina (Yeah)
Ela é viciada (Viciada), viciada pelo estilo de vida e pelo Patek (Patek)
Paizão, você já sentiu os tecidos da Chanel? (Chanel)
Vou ser estiloso até a morte, preciso de um caixão (Estiloso)
E temos mais listras do que o árbitro, ele falta, TEC nele (Bow, listras)
No meio do campo igual o David Beckham (Campo, bow-bow)
Todos os meus manos presos, de verdade, tô tentando ajudá-los (Liberdade, Liberdade)
Quando eu ganhei um milhão, me deu arrepios, não sei o que aconteceu (Hoo, arrepios)
Tomo pílulas, faço o que eu quero, eu tô naquele zumbi (Hey, hoo)
Eu sou mais o Gaddafi, não sou nenhum Gandhi (Gaddafi, hey)
Eu sou mais o David, Golias correndo (Hey, hey)
Os manos são clonados, eu acho engraçado (Clone, haha)
Somos do Nawf, direto da masmorra (Somos do Nawf, hey)
Eu vou na boca dela, ela não pode me dizer nada (Eghck, eghck, egchk)
300, o relógio tá fora do seu orçamento (Woo, woo, 300)
A maldade me pegou
Yeah, e essa arma saiu direto da Rússia

Água gelada, virou Atlântica (Congelou)
De noite em um Phantom (Skrrt, Skrrt)

Em um Hellcat porque eu fui criado no inferno
Homem feito, eu não devo favor pra nenhum mano
Quando você conseguir esse dinheiro, mano, mantenha seu coração
Eu tô deslizando no carro, não precisa de chave pra ligar
Eu levo a arma comigo no BET Awards
Quando seu poço secar, você sabe que precisa de mim pra isso
Quando eu estaciono no Buick, você sabe o que tô fazendo
Se a polícia ficar atrás de mim, eu vou fugir e vazar
Dormindo na paleta me transformou em um selvagem
Eu sou um bebê do projeto, agora moro em Calabasas
Como se eu ainda servisse aos demônios, como se ainda estivesse afirmando
Eu tô bebendo lean, tento manter o equilíbrio
Andando naquela Z-Walk, Dickie's com meus Reeboks
Eu não falo muito, apenas deixo a arma falar
Suas joias mexem na água, diamantes tipo re-rock
Minha mina cavalga no pau como se tivesse numa gangorra
Quando eu entrei na cena, eu tava com uma mira
Quando eu entrei na Beam', eu tava de Celine
Garotinha, você é apenas uma aventura, não é isso que quero dizer
Dinheiro pulando pra fora do meu jeans, igual eu faço o esquema

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold

I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

Épico
Salte 'el medio, ¿okay?
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, eh (Suénalo)
Me dijeron que te acabas de dejar (Eh)
Que el bobo aquel te engañó
Que ya no crees en el amor (No)
Que andas suelta igual que yo (Bad Bunny)
No sé, pero la noche está pa’ desquitarno' (Hey, hey)
Otro shot vamo' a darno’ (Mujeres, get ready, sube)
Que yo también quiero joder, vacilar (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Trae a to'a tus amiga', que yo las voy a poner a fumar
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar, yeh

Porque 'tar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra, rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Por eso ella no se enamora (Dile; ¡no!)
Estar soltera está de moda (D-D-D-D-D-D.Y.)
Por eso no va a cambiar (¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh, wuh), con su' amiga’ revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Prr)
'Tá soltera (Fuego), con su' amiga' revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta' (Fue', fue'. fue')

Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú, las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero (D-D-D.Y)

Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Chi-chi-chi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar

Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)
Estar soltera está de moda (Yeh)
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Blu, blu)
'Ta-'tar soltera está de moda (Sube, sube)
Por eso no va a cambiar

Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con las de ella', no te asuste' (¡No!)
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busque'
Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""Next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

Ponte-ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

(Yeh, yeh)
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Vacilar ¡Wuh!)
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Wi-wi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar (Brr)

Que estar soltera está de moda
Hace lo que quiera y que se joda
Estar soltera está de moda
Ella no le va a bajar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra-rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda (Sí)
Por eso no va a cam-cam-cambiar (Fue')

Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh-wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta' (D-D-D)

Would you believe me now if I told you I got caught up in a wave?
Almost gave it away
Would you hear me out if I told you I was terrified for days?
Thought I was gonna break

Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to slow it all down
Crying in the bathroom
Had to figure it out
With everyone around me saying
""You must be so happy now""

Oh, if you keep reaching out
Then I'll keep coming back
And if you're gone for good
Then I'm okay with that
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)
And I am finding out
There's just no other way
That I'm still dancing at the end of the day
If you leave the light on
Then I'll leave the light on (Light on, light on, light on)

And do you believe me now that I always had the best intentions, babe?
Always wanted to stay
Can you feel me now that I'm vulnerable in oh-so-many ways?
Oh, and I'll never change

Oh, I couldn't stop it
Tried to figure it out
But everything kept moving
And the noise got too loud

This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind

We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it

Brincando com meu nome, essa merda é letal, mano (Quem você disse que era?)
Don Corleone
Confie em mim, no topo não é solitário (Armado)

Não diga que você tá abatido, você tem que me mostrar (O que você tem que fazer?)
Traga o pente de volta vazio (Tá vazio)

Eu acabei de terminar com ela por 10 peças, mano (10 peças, mano)

E um monte de manos precisam que você vá embora
Ainda chego forte neles de qualquer maneira

All my niggas got me makin' money online

Shawty wanna fuck but I give her no time (JAE5)

Want to make a mil', 9-5 weren't an option
In the field you kinda run outta options
She always complain like she nah see me often
But often I be OT tourin'
Gyal don't worry I'll be yard in the mornin'
Used to move like there's nothin' to lose
Mixed the Off-White with the Hues
Rollin' with like 10 of the goons

Money callin', money talkin'
Trap phone goin' ring ring
Trap phone buy me bling-bling, yeah
Where was you way back then?
I was doing stick up with my bad friends
Police had us twist up pon the landin'
Every other time mix up in violence

Not just because of the bustdown
But I'm on the grind 'till I'm up now
Hustle in the blood, I'm a hustler
Tough striker call me Costa
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line ringin' all day
And my line ringin' from qway
Trap line singin' all day

We don't fly Europe, we just go Vegas
Man try draws her, she don't do strangers
Fuck about status, uh
'Bout Corsa, put her in a Porsche
Eyebrow sharpish, lookin' like my borer
Come a long way from chillin' on a corner
Fat ass, bloody hell that's torture
I ain't getting poorer
Always complain that she can't see me often
I just keep it real, I can't run out of option
I can see you're stressed out and you keep callin'

Amazing, all of this money I'm making
Nights on the back roads, didn't phase me
Did it for the culture where they raised me
About to make a move
Might have to sell food
Do what you gotta do
And tell the judge, ""Free the goons""

Put that loud pack in my loud pack
And I'm totin' it quick plus all of the gang
Baby girl you look familiar
Convo start and mi wan' fi get familiar, sho
Girl,​ I'm a trendy yute
Lemme put you in them new Fendi shoes
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
Guys only hate when they wanna be you
I can never be you, nah nah

In the field you're gonna run outta options

She said, ""Nigga, you don't make no time for me""
Because mi trap-trap 'til the early mornin'
And now they pray on the downfall of me

Ниггеры пишут безумства в твитах (Кто)
Они не хотят этого, потому что я победил (Они не хотят)
Я пикнул, что эти ниггеры милые (Слабы)

Каждую неделю здесь новый чудак (Чудак)

Моя сука на твоей жопе, Ким К (Да)
Нет неуважения (Неа)

Обмениваем тачки с сукой
Я купил ей Lamborghini, она купила мне Wraith (Обмениваемся)
Практикуйся, практикуйся, практика улучшает
Ниггер, никогда не поздно (Никогда, никогда, никогда)
Я взял сссс с змея (Я взял душу с змея)
Не вижу счета в банке (Деньги)
Блоги и новости лживы (Они лживы)
Чутка разболтался, я говорю прямо (Я прям)
Я не буду кусать приманку (Неа)
Потягивая на токсичные отходы (Грязь)
На низких скоростях с твоей сукой и это великолепно (На низких)
На её лице маска, Джейсон
Беги к набору, мы уже в форме (Покажи)
Если я разорюсь, то она меня бросит (Она ушла)
Я на всякий случай положил 2 миллиона в сейф, не иди по моей дороге (Это не гон)
У моих детей должны быть деньги, не только у меня (Факты)
Это эгоистично (Это эгоистично)
О, я взял корону с короля, как взял Майк с Элвиса (О, я взял это)
О, мир дикий, он умирает
Не лги, что не помог ему (Мир дик)
О, твоя сука хочет сосать, а потом чтобы капало и ты не можешь ей помочь

Я должна была вести целый блог с такой скоростью
Они используют моё имя для кликбэйта (Кликбэйт)
Суки даже хотят начать лживый конфликт (Лживый конфликт)
Чтобы продать свои маленькие стишки и микстэйп
Они знают – я бомба, и они списывают меня со счетов
Говорят всё, чтобы получить ответ
Я знаю это означает, что их трафик низкий
Кто-то просто будет практиковаться, чтобы начать
Поэтому нахуй быть прирученным, я предпочитаю быть диким
Как только у этих сучек появится что-то для продажи
Они скажут моё имя, скажут моё имя, Destiny Child
Все хотят быть освящёнными, все хотят быть богатыми
Все хотят быть этим, если бы я был тобой, то я бы ненавидел себя, сука
Читай мои стихи, ниггер, соси мой хрен
Все эти разговоры, и я призываю их

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer, I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang, that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close, let the Glock .22 spray

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged

Kurt ve ben aynı hissediyoruz
Çok fazla haz acı verir
Kız arkadaşım beni boşa harcıyor, tek yaptığım şikayet etmek
Değişmesi gereken bir şeye ihtiyacı var, kenara çekmek gerek
Bu gece hepsini boşver
Çenemi kapamamı söyleme bana
Çok fazla konuştuğunun farkındayken
Ama boş konuşuyorsun

Aklımdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Bu gece yatak odamdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Seni kurtarmamın bir yolu yok
Çünkü benim de kurtarılmam lazım
Vedalarda iyi değilimdir
İkimiz de deli gibi davranıyoruz
Ama değişmek için fazla inatçıyız
Şimdi yine içiyorum
80 promil var kanımda
Ve Parmak uçlarım lekeli, kenara bakıyorum
Bu gece benimle uğraşma
Bu kalbe ihtiyacın olduğunu söyledin ve elde de ettin
Belli ki istediğin bu değilmiş
Ve vazgeçemedik, sonra da kaybettik
Şimdi gidiciyim

Kafamdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Bu gece yatak odamdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Seni kurtarmamın bir yolu yok
Çünkü benim de kurtarılmam lazım
Vedalarda iyi değilimdir

Hayatımdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Bu gece geri gelmeni istiyorum
Seni kesip atmaya çalışıyorum bıçağım olmadan
Seni küp küp doğramak istiyorum
Kalbim sahipleniyor, titizlikle kesip atıyor seni
TV’yi kapatmayabilir misin? Kavgayı izliyorum
Çalmadan, elmaslarla, garajı doldurdum
Nicki Minaj, sen gerçek Barbie bebeksin
Sürmek için anahtara gerek yok, araban şarjda
Sadece rahatsız edilmeyen kesimin yaşamını görmek istiyorum
Ve asla dışarı çıkmamanı istiyorum
Yemin ederim, dostlarıma yamuk yaparlarsa
Havada karada belaları olurum

Aklımdan çıkmanı istiyorum
Yatak odamdan çıkmanı istiyorum bu gece
Seni kurtarmamın bir yolu yok
Çünkü benim de kurtarılmam lazım
Vedalarda iyi değilimdir

Elveda, elveda, elveda
Elveda, elveda, elveda
Elveda, elveda, elveda

Bohemian Rhapsody - Remastered 2011,Queen,"12 ContributorsBohemian Rhapsody (2011 Remaster) Lyrics
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!

Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

I see wrist bust-down nigga, twenty on each
That's a big back baby come and fling it on me
Rosé by the case when I Bon Appétit
Watch your girl, 'cah she digging the drip
If she with me then she ain't a regular bitch
Rock my world, she a freak, Little Mix
We got a freezer in the Range shorty come take a sip
Gucci on her hip with the Fashionova thick
Can you do a trick? Can you do it on a dick?
That's a big fat couple racks spend it on a coat
Hit me on a low, I got money that I'm tryna blow
Money that I'm tryna throw, six figures on a deal-y
Feel like Biggaveli now I got a lil Kimmy
Yo feel like Makaveli when I pull up in the city
Buss' a dance for me, I ain't talkin' 'bout The Shiggy

Heh, wrap another zoot
Tell her turn around, show me what the back of it can do
Loosen up, shake it off, back it up a few
Them other girls are too jealous, they ain't flashier than you (no way)
Bend it over, push it on me then rotate your hips (woo!)
When we fucked she let me take a pic
One chance, are you leaving or are you taking it?
I got some white chocolate, I promise you'll like the taste of it
Blitzed a couple bottles now I'm zoned out
Mandem moving mad, more time they're getting thrown out
Hold that position, quick let me get my phone out
Babe just do me a favour and---

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh
(Você tá bem, T-Minus?)
Oh

Me encontre no The London
Se você tiver tempo, nós podemos fazer um
Conversar sobre algumas coisas que não podemos desfazer
Você pode enviar o endereço, eu posso encontrar você
1,85, no dinheiro, 2,80
Você pode dizer a palavra e eu vou repassar
Dois textos, sem resposta, foi quando eu soube
Eu sabia, eu sabia, yeah, eu sabia

Yeah, circunavego o globo еnquanto o dinheiro cresce (Crеsce)
Pego um mano golpeado, igual você corta a grama (Corta)
Eu tô falando muito bem quando tô com o Big Slime, mano (Slime)
Posso foder sua vadia, você nunca poderia foder a minha, mano (Minha)
Na minha DM, os elétricos deslizam, mano (Huh, deslizam)
Sem bagre, isso não é uma fritada de peixe, mano
Nunca troco de lado com o meu parça
Pego um contato, pego uma carona, vou pra Marte
Todos cantam
Como você pode sair do seu rosto
E dizer que eu não sou o mano mais foda que você já ouviu?
Eu deixei um bando de rappers mortos e enterrados
Um verso meu é tipo 11 pássaros
Apenas fiz as contas, isso é tipo 2 mil dólares em cada palavra
Eu tô na iminência, vou vencer a pressão
Eu matei alguns manos e fui embora a partir daí
Então eu observo, apenas como você vira
Então disse pro mano que eles têm que esperar por isso
""Eu conheço—eu conheço você em alta demanda""
Eu tô brilhando na frente do pau do cu igual Juwanna Mann
Eu tô me afogando dentro da buceta como se nunca tivesse nadado
Ayy, foda-se o seu IG, eu coloquei algo no seu ultrassom
Eu sou o cara, ayy, ayy

Me encontre no The London
Se você tiver tempo, nós podemos fazer um
Conversar sobre algumas coisas que não podemos desfazer
Você pode enviar o endereço, eu posso encontrar você
1,85, no dinheiro, 2,80
Você pode dizer a palavra e eu vou repassar
Dois textos, sem resposta, foi quando eu soube
Eu sabia, eu sabia, yeah, eu sabia

Papo de cafetão, Papo de igreja, eu posso fazer um corre de tijolos (Woo)
Para o norte, para o sul, Bankhead para Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Bato com um pouco de água, estico igual uma corda vocal
DST, eu corro no meu médico, foda-se um federal e sua filha (Vamos)
Eu sou o administrador do complexo (Yeah)
Eu forneço os cigarros e o pão (Woo)
Eu tenho uma principal e ela vai cavalgar (Uh-huh)
Ela pegou 250 mil e vazou (Uh)
Eu tô na Lamb', então ela vai cavalgar (Yeah)
Eu vejo a dor nos olhos castanhos-claros de gata (Ooh)
Eu tô no London com algumas gostosas
Sem batatas fritas, ela come bifes com os lados do peixe
Sua mãe não te disse quando algo pegava fogo, pare, se jogue e role? (Aw yeah)
Eu estive na estrada como um par de gostosas no Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
Eu poderia atacá-los igual um Dodge Hemi Demon
Tenho sua mina na garagem comendo sêmen
Cada vez que um mano volta pra enfermaria
Os manos agem como se quisessem começar
E nós deixamos eles no cimento (Grra, grra)

Me encontre no The London
Se você tiver tempo, nós podemos fazer um
Conversar sobre algumas coisas que não podemos desfazer
Você pode enviar o endereço, eu posso encontrar você

Você pode dizer a palavra e eu vou repassar
Dois textos, sem resposta, foi quando eu soube
Eu sabia, eu sabia, yeah, eu sabia

Eu, desabo, nós ganhamos dinheiro (Hey)
Pela cidade inteira (Woah, quando você não quer jogar, eu)
Eu decidi, pelo lado inteiro (Putas vão dizer)
E eles sabem, eu posso (E voar, eu...)
Se abaixe, talvez (Não brinque)
Vejo a cidade inteira toda vez, eu... (Oh, todo dia)
Yeah, eles sabem o que tá rolando (As pessoas vão dizer)",3611.0,the london (feat. j. cole and travis scott),young thug
